The African penguin is a small penguin that lives in southern Africa. It is also known as the black-footed penguin, Cape penguin, or jackass penguin. It is an endangered species of bird. The scientific name of the African penguin is Spheniscus demersus.

Like many penguins, African penguins are social birds. They live in colonies along the west and southeast coasts of southern Africa. They are found from the west coast of Namibia to the east coast of South Africa.

African penguins are about 24–27 inches (60–68 centimeters) long and weigh 7–11 pounds (3–5 kilograms). The feathers on the chin and back are black. Most of the chest feathers are white. White feathers also appear in a C-shaped pattern on both sides of the head. Young penguins have gray feathers instead of black ones. Chicks have gray fluff or brown-gray feathers.

Like all penguins, African penguins are flightless birds that swim well. African penguins feed mainly on squid, mackerel, and anchovies. To attract a mate, both sexes make a sound that is similar to the braying of a donkey. That is why they are sometimes called jackass penguins (a jackass is a male donkey). Both parents care for their young. On land, African penguins are preyed upon by leopards, mongooses, and feral cats. In the water, they are preyed upon by seals and sharks.

From the 1980s to the early 2000s, the African penguin population dropped by more than 60 percent. Some of the birds were lost to predators, but human activities caused many others to die. Large-scale fisheries reduced the food supply for the penguins. African penguins are also often the victims of man-made disasters such as oil spills. In 2010 African penguins were officially listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.
