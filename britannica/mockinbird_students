Of all North American birds, by far the most famed for its vocal imitations is the mockingbird. Besides its own rapturous song, the common mockingbird’s repertoire has been known to include the songs of 39 other species of birds, 50 different call notes, the cackling of a hen, and the barking of a dog.

The mockingbird is the size of a robin—about 10 1/2 inches (27 centimeters) long with a wingspan of about 14 inches (36 centimeters). It is ashy gray above, paler below, with conspicuous white wing patches. The long, rounded tail is edged with white. Mockingbirds feed on insects—primarily grasshoppers and beetles—as well as on seeds and berries. They are active, aggressive, and inquisitive. In the vigorous defense of their young they will attack dogs, cats, or even humans. They nest close to the ground in the branches of small trees, bushes, or vines. In the summer the female lays four to five greenish-blue eggs spotted with brown.

The scientific name of the mockingbird family is Mimidae, from the Latin mimus, meaning “mimic” or “imitator.” The family includes the catbirds and thrashers. The name of the common mockingbird is Mimus polyglottos. The common mockingbird ranges from the northern United States to Mexico and the West Indies. It is the state bird of Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas.
