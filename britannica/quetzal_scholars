quetzal, (genus Pharomachrus), any of five species of colourful birds belonging to the genus Pharomachrus of the trogon family (Trogonidae). All five species—the white-tipped quetzal (P. fulgidus), the crested quetzal (P. antisianus), the golden-headed quetzal (P. auriceps), the resplendent quetzal (P. mocinno), and the pavonine quetzal (P. pavoninus)—reside in the neotropics (Central America and South America).

Quetzals are found from southern Mexico to Bolivia. The resplendent quetzal and the golden-headed quetzal are the only species found in Central America. The resplendent quetzal was the sacred bird of the ancient Mayas and Aztecs. Today the resplendent quetzal is the national emblem of Guatemala (whose monetary unit is the quetzal). The resplendent quetzal’s long blue-green plumes cover its tail, which shows white beneath, in flight. Its head, with a rounded hairlike crest, and the upper part of its breast are gold-green. The bird’s back is blue with a gold-tinged mantle, and its belly is red.

Adult quetzals are 33 to 40 cm (about 13 to 16 inches) long, but several species have tail feathers that extend much farther. For example, male golden-headed and crested quetzals have tail feathers that grow up to approximately 17 cm (6.7 inches) and 76 cm (roughly 30 inches), respectively, and male resplendent quetzals have tail feathers that may grow up to 90 cm (35 inches) in length.
