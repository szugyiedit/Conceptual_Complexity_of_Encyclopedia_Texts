 The second largest living bird in the world is the flightless emu of Australia; only the ostrich of Africa is larger. Several species of emu once existed, but all but one species were hunted to extinction by European settlers in Australia and Tasmania. Today the emu is the sole living member of the family Dromaiidae (or Dromiceiidae) of the order Casuariiformes, which also includes the cassowaries. The emu’s scientific name is Dromaius (or Dromiceius) novaehollandiae. (See also flightless bird.)

Emus are more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall and may weigh more than 100 pounds (45 kilograms). The females are slightly larger than the males. Emus have stout bodies and long legs. Both sexes are brownish, with a dark gray head and neck. Emus can dash away at nearly 30 miles (50 kilometers) per hour; if cornered, the birds kick with their big, three-toed feet.

Emus inhabit forests, coastal areas, wetlands, rainforests, arid spaces, and other spots where the birds can find plentiful water and food. Emus forage in small groups for fruits, seeds, nuts, insects, and small vertebrates; emus may damage crops.

Several females may lay their eggs in the same ground nest. A male emu then incubates about 7 to 10 dark green eggs for about 60 days. The striped young soon run with the adults, with the male caring for them until they are several months old. Emus are fully grown by about two years of age. The peculiar structure of the emu’s trachea helps make the loud booming note of the bird during the breeding season.

Three emu subspecies are recognized, inhabiting northern, southeastern, and southwestern Australia. A fourth emu subspecies, now extinct, lived on Tasmania.
