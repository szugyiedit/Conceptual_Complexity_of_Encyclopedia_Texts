 Gliding on tireless and apparently motionless wings, the albatross may follow a ship for days. The great ocean bird used to hold a strange spell over sailors who believed that it had unnatural power, and that killing one brought bad luck. The famous poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is based on this old superstition.

The wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) has the greatest wingspread of any bird. Though its body is only about 9 inches (23 centimeters) wide, its wings often measure more than 11 feet (3 meters) from tip to tip. It weighs about 25 pounds (11 kilograms). The maleâ€™s body feathers are white and the tips of its wings quite black. The female has brownish patches on its neck and back.

The albatross spends most of its life flying and soaring. It sits down on the water to eat, floating like a cork, and scoops up small squids, fish, or scraps from ships with its yellow hooked beak. At times it skims the surface of the water, then soars so high it is out of sight. It may stand still in the air, balanced with delicate wing motion against the breeze; yet, when taking advantage of a favorable wind, its speed may exceed 100 miles (160 kilometers) an hour. During the nesting season these birds typically go to remote oceanic islands where the female lays a single egg on the bare ground or in a nest of clay and grass.

There are about 17 species of albatross. The black-footed species (D. nigripes) wanders as far north as Alaska and is often seen on the Pacific coast of North America.
