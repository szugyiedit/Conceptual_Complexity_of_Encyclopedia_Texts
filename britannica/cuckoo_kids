The birds called cuckoos are named for the sounds they make. Because of their shy personality, these birds are more often heard than seen.

More than 125 different types of cuckoos are found throughout the world. Examples include the common cuckoo, the yellow-billed cuckoo, and the birds called roadrunners, coucals, and anis. Most cuckoos live in forests, where they hide in thick vegetation. Other types live in open areas. Most cuckoos eat insects, especially caterpillars.

Cuckoos range in length from about 61/2 to 36 inches (17 to 91 centimeters). Most of them are drab gray or brown. A few types have some brightly colored or glossy feathers. The cuckoo has a long tail and medium to long legs. Its outer toes point backward. Its bill is usually short and curves down a bit.

Some kinds of cuckoos, including the common cuckoo, do not raise their own young. Instead, they lay eggs in the nests of other kinds of birds that have similar-looking eggs. In this way the cuckoos trick the other birds into keeping the cuckoo eggs warm and caring for the young cuckoos. However, many cuckoos, including the roadrunners, care for their own eggs and young.
