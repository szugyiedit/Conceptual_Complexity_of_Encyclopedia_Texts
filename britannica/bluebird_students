One of the early voices of the northern spring is the bluebird’s. In spite of its sad song, this brilliantly colored bird is the symbol of happiness. It is found in common places, such as fields, orchards, and gardens.

The nest is always placed in some cavity—a hollow apple tree, abandoned woodpecker hole, rotted fence post, bird box, even in rural mailboxes. The bottom is lined with dry grasses, on which the female lays four to six bluish-white eggs. A wise farmer protects bluebirds, because they eat harmful insects.

Bluebirds belong to the thrush family, Turdidae. The scientific name of the eastern, or common, bluebird is Sialia sialis sialis; length, 7 inches (17.5 centimeters); upperparts bright blue, tipped with rust in fall; throat, breast, and sides, chestnut; female, grayish blue, underparts paler than male; range, east of Rockies, from Labrador to Florida; during the winters from middle states to Gulf; state bird of Missouri and of New York.

The mountain, or Arctic, bluebird is S. currucoides; length, 7 1/4 inches (18 centimeters); cerulean blue; female, brownish gray with blue wings and tail; range, mountains of western North America; winters in southern United States and Mexico.

The western bluebird is S. mexicana occidentalis; length, 7 inches (17.5 centimeters); upperparts purplish blue and chestnut, underparts chestnut; range, from western Nevada and Idaho to the Pacific coast and north to British Columbia; winters in Mexico.
