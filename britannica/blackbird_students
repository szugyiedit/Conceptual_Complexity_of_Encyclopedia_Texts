Various relatives of the meadowlarks and orioles are known as blackbirds. The grackles, the cowbirds, and the red-winged, yellow-headed, rusty, and Brewer’s blackbirds are members of this large group. Most blackbirds are found in North America, where they nest in marshes, on dry prairies, or in dense evergreen forests. The redwings have musical songs. Others, with much wing fluttering, bobbing, and wagging of tails, produce only a medley of harsh squeaks and gurgling clucks.

Red-winged blackbirds live in cattail marshes. The males are all black with bright red epaulets. The streaked brown female resembles a large sparrow. The yellow-headed blackbird of the Western plains also nests in marshes.

The great-tailed grackle is larger than the redwing, with a long tail shaped like the keel of a boat. It inhabits the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts and is the largest of the blackbirds.

The cowbird is common in woods and pastures. The male has a brown head and greenish black body. The female is gray-brown. Cowbirds lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. Male rusty and Brewer’s blackbirds are black, with greenish or purplish black heads.

Most blackbirds belong to the family Icteridae. The Eurasian blackbird is a member of the thrush family, Turdidae. It is a beautiful songbird and a popular cage bird. The scientific name of the red-winged blackbird is Agelaius phoeniceus; yellow-headed blackbird, Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus; great-tailed grackle, Quiscalus mexicanus; cowbird, Molothrus ater; Brewer’s blackbird, Euphagus cyanocephalus; rusty blackbird, E. carolinus; Eurasian blackbird, Turdus merula.
