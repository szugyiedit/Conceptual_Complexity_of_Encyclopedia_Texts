Robins are familiar and much-loved songbirds with reddish chest feathers. Several species, or types, of bird are called robins. The best-known types are the American robin and the European robin. Early European settlers in North America named the American robin after the European bird. Both these types belong to the thrush family, along with bluebirds and nightingales. But American and European robins are not closely related.

American and European robins were originally woodland birds. They are now also commonly found in gardens, on lawns, and in parks. American robins are found throughout most of North America. Most of them fly south for the winter. European robins are found throughout Europe and in parts of western Asia and northern Africa. Some of the robins of northern Europe fly south for the winter.

The American robin is about 10 inches (25 centimeters) long. It has an orange or dull reddish breast and belly. The head is black, and the upper parts are dark gray. Females and young males are paler than adult males.

The European robin is much smaller, with a length of about 5.5 inches (14 centimeters). It has orange-red feathers on its breast, throat, and face. The belly is white, and the upper parts are brownish olive.

Both types of robin are often seen hopping across lawns. They look for worms or insects to pull up from the soil. American robins eat worms, insects, and fruits. European robins eat mainly insects but also some worms, fruits, and seeds.
