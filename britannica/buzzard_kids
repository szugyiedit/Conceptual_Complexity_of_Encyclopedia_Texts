Buzzards are carnivorous birds, which means that they eat other animals for food. They are in the same family of birds as hawks and are considered birds of prey. The best-known buzzard is the common or true buzzard.

The common buzzard is found from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south. Other species, or kinds, range over much of North America, Eurasia, and northern Africa. They live in hills, wooded valleys, and farmland with scattered woods.

When in flight, buzzards can be recognized by their broad wings and large rounded tails. Their wingspan may be anywhere between 48 and 60 inches (120 to 150 centimeters). They fly with slow, heavy wing beats and soar gracefully. The feathers of most buzzards are dark brown above and white or light brown below. The tail and underside of the wings are usually striped. The color of these birds varies.

Buzzards eat insects and small mammals. They also occasionally attack other birds. They are slow fliers, so they do not usually catch their prey on the move. Instead, buzzards perch motionless on a branch while waiting patiently for a rabbit, rat, or mouse to pass beneath it. Then they swoop down and surprise their prey.

Buzzards build big nests, usually in a tree or on a cliff. They build these nests with sticks and line them with softer materials. They generally lay two to five eggs. The eggs are white and brown.
