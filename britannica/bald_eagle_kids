The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States. Its white head feathers stand out against its dark brown body. The bright white head gives the eagle its “bald” look.

Bald eagles are the only eagles that live just in North America. They are commonly found near rivers and large lakes.

Female bald eagles are larger than males. A female may be as long as 3.5 feet (1.1 meters). Her wings may reach 8 feet (2.5 meters) across. A male is about 3 feet (0.9 meter) long, with a wingspan of about 6.5 feet (2 meters). Males and females have the same coloring.

Bald eagles belong to the sea eagle group. This type of eagle uses its claws to snatch fish out of water. Besides fish, bald eagles hunt other birds, small mammals, snakes, turtles, and crabs. They also eat dead animals.

Bald eagles build nests in tall trees or on high rocks. Nests can be more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide. Both parents take care of their eggs and young.

The bald eagle became the U.S. national bird in 1782. At that time, there were probably hundreds of thousands of bald eagles. By the mid-1900s hunters had killed many thousands of them. A pesticide called DDT also harmed the eagles’ eggs. In the early 1960s fewer than 450 pairs were left in the wild.

In 1978 the United States put the bald eagle on its list of endangered species. This protection helped the birds to increase their numbers. The bald eagle was removed from the list of endangered species in 2007.
