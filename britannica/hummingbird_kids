A hummingbird is a small bird with a long, slender bill. Many hummingbirds have brightly colored, glittery feathers. Often the males are more colorful than the females. The birds are named for the humming sound made by the rapid beating of their wings.

There are about 320 kinds of hummingbirds. They live only in the Americas. Most of them live in the warmer parts of South America. About 12 kinds are found regularly in the United States and Canada.

All hummingbirds are small, and many are tiny. The largest of these birds is only about 8 inches (20 centimeters) long. It is called the giant hummingbird. The bee hummingbird is slightly longer than 2 inches (5 centimeters). It is the smallest living bird of any kind.

Hummingbirds have long wings and muscular bodies. They can fly forward, sideways, straight up or down, and even backward. Hummingbirds also hover, or hang in one place while beating their wings. Some small hummingbirds beat their wings 80 times per second.

Hummingbirds feed mainly on nectar, a sweet liquid made by flowers. The bird hovers in front of the flower and reaches inside with its long, curved bill. Hummingbirds drink nectar at the rate of about 3 to 13 licks per second.

Grains of pollen often stick to hummingbirds while they are feeding. They carry the pollen from flower to flower. This helps the plant to reproduce.
