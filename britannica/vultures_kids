Introduction

Vultures are large birds of prey. Unlike other birds of prey, vultures usually do not hunt for live animals. They mostly eat dead meat and garbage instead. When one vulture finds a dead or dying animal, others fly in from miles away to share in the meal.

Some of the biggest of all flying birds are vultures. Vultures can fly for hours, soaring gracefully on their long, broad wings. Their feathers are usually brown, black, or white. However, most vultures do not have feathers on their heads and necks. Vultures have excellent eyesight.

Vultures live mainly in warm regions. There are two groups of vultures, New World vultures and Old World vultures. They have many similar characteristics, but they are not closely related.

New World Vultures

The New World vultures live in North and South America. They are probably related to storks. The black vulture is a New World vulture that is about 24 inches (61 centimeters) long. The California condor is a huge vulture in this group. It may reach 55 inches (139 centimeters) long with a wingspread of about 9.5 feet (2.9 meters). It nearly died out in the late 20th century. However, scientists are trying to save the California condor. Other New World vultures include the turkey vulture, king vulture, and Andean condor.

Old World Vultures

The Old World vultures live in Europe, Asia, and Africa. They are closely related to eagles and hawks. The cinereous vulture is a large bird in this group. It is about 39 inches (99 centimeters) long. The lappet-faced vulture is about the same size. Large folds of skin, called lappets, hang down from its head. Other Old World vultures include the griffon vulture and Egyptian vulture.
