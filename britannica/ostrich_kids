The ostrich is the largest living bird. Its scientific name is Struthio camelus. Unlike most other birds, the ostrich cannot fly. But it can run very fast. To escape humans and other meat-eating animals, an ostrich can run at a speed of 45 miles (72 kilometers) per hour.

In the wild ostriches are found in the countryside in parts of Africa. Some people also raise ostriches for the birds’ meat, eggs, and hides.

Ostriches are tall birds. The males may reach a height of 8 feet (2.4 meters) or more. The neck accounts for almost half the height. The females are somewhat smaller.

Male ostriches are mostly black, with white feathers on the wings and tail. The females are mostly brown. An ostrich’s head and neck are lightly covered with short feathers. The legs are strong and do not have any feathers. Each leg ends in two toes. Ostriches have big brown eyes with thick lashes.

Ostriches use their short, wide bills to graze on grasses and other plants. They sometimes eat insects, too. They can go without water for long periods of time.

The eggs of ostriches are the largest eggs in the world. They average about 6 inches (15 centimeters) in length and 5 inches (13 centimeters) across. Ostrich chicks hatch from their eggs in about 40 days.
