Flamingos are tall, mostly pink birds with long legs. A flamingo often stands with its long, thin neck curved into an S shape. Flamingos fly and feed in large flocks of hundreds to even millions of birds.

Like storks, herons, and ibises, flamingos are wading birds. This means that they feed while standing or walking in shallow water. Flamingos live in warm regions near lakes and bodies of water called lagoons.

There are five species, or types, of flamingo. The most common type is the lesser flamingo. It is found mainly in eastern and southern Africa and India. Other types of flamingo come from Central and South America, Caribbean islands, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia.

A flamingo has webbed feet, a slender body, large wings, and a short tail. Its head is small, and its bill curves downward. It stands between about 3 feet (almost 1 meter) and 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall.

Flamingos feed with their heads down in shallow water or mud. A flamingoâ€™s bill has a series of hairlike plates inside that act as a filter. The bird uses its bill to strain food from the water. Flamingos eat tiny living things such as algae and small animals such as shrimp and snails.
