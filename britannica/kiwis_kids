Kiwis are small birds that cannot fly. They are the national symbol of New Zealand, where their image appears on the country’s money, postage stamps, and road signs.

Kiwis live only in New Zealand. There are several species, or types, of kiwi. They are found in different parts of the islands that make up the country. The birds are found mainly in forested areas.

The grayish brown birds are the size of a chicken. They have wings, but the wings are very small and are hidden within the bird’s feathers. Kiwis have a long, flexible bill with long whiskers at the base. The legs are strong, and each of the four toes has a large claw.

Kiwis sleep during the day in burrows. At night they come out to look for food. They eat worms, insects and their larvae, and fruits and berries.

Female kiwis lay one or two large white eggs at a time. The eggs are unusually large compared to the size of the birds themselves. After a female lays the egg in a burrow her mate watches over the egg until the baby bird hatches. The chick hatches fully feathered and with its eyes open. It is born with enough food in its belly to survive for about a week. After that it starts to look for food for itself.
