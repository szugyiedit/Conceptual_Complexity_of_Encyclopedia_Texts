Many types of small, brownish or grayish songbirds are called sparrows. They are among the best-known birds in the world. They live in a wide range of places, including cities, farms, grasslands, woodlands, and marshes. Sparrows eat mostly seeds and insects.

Many types of sparrow look fairly similar. They all have cone-shaped bills, which they use to crush seeds. They all are small birds with various patterns and streaks. For instance, the house sparrow is about 5 to 6 inches (12 to 15 centimeters) long. It has brown or reddish brown upper parts and a gray underside. The male has black on the throat and around the eyes. The song sparrow is about the same size or slightly larger. Its wings and tail are reddish brown. Its breast is white with many dark streaks, often with a dark spot in the center.

Despite their similarities, not all sparrows are closely related. There are two main groups of sparrows: Old World sparrows and New World sparrows. These groups belong to separate bird families.
