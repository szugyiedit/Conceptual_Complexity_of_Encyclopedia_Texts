 Most of the small brown shorebirds seen along the edges of seas, lakes, marshes, and mud flats are sandpipers and their relatives. The sandpiper family includes the sanderlings, the snipes, and the woodcocks. However, the name sandpiper refers particularly to several species of small to middle-sized birds that throng at the water’s edge.

Many of the sandpipers nest in the Northern Hemisphere during summer and migrate in winter to the Southern Hemisphere. The birds are brownish or gray above and white or cream-colored below. They generally have long bills and legs and short necks and tails. Some species have distinguishing features, but their general appearance is similar and it is difficult to tell most species apart. Some of the most colorful species are the purple and buff-breasted sandpipers.

The most familiar New World species is the spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularia), common on seacoasts and lakes. It characteristically tilts its body forward and bobs its tail up and down. The closely related common sandpiper (A. hypoleucos) is abundant on grassy shores throughout Eurasia. The solitary sandpiper (Tringa solitaria) resembles the spotted sandpiper and occurs in many of the same areas.

The unusual spoon-billed sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus) of Asia has a flattened bill modified for filtering minute organisms from surface mud. The upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), is also called Bartram’s sandpiper. It is also called, mistakenly, the upland plover. It is an American bird of open fields. Scientists group the sandpipers in the family Scolopacidae. (See also bird; sanderling; woodcock.)
