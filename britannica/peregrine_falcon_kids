Peregrine falcons are birds of prey, meaning that they hunt and eat animals for food. They are also called duck hawks. The scientific name for the peregrine falcon is Falco peregrinus.

Peregrine falcons are found throughout the world. They are common in rocky country near water, where there are many birds. They prefer high places, such as the cliffs along river gorges.

A peregrine falcon is bluish gray on the back and on the outer wings. The underside of a peregrine falcon is white or yellowish with black marks. Black marks also appear on the head and beak. The wingspan is large, about 3 feet (1 meter). The peregrine falcon is 19 inches (48 centimeters) long and weighs about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).

Peregrine falcons are very fast birds. They mainly hunt and eat other birds, such as pigeons and ducks. They often catch prey in the air after a fast chase. A peregrine falcon also hunts by flying high and then diving at prey. The peregrine falcon can dive at speeds of up to 200 miles (320 kilometers) per hour toward its prey. It kills the prey by hitting it with closed talons, or claws.

Peregrine falcons lay three or four reddish brown eggs at a time. The young leave the nest in five to six weeks.
