or gorgeous plumage, few birds surpass the quetzal. Found in rainforests from southern Mexico to Bolivia, the quetzal was the sacred bird of the ancient Mayas and Aztecs; today it is the national emblem of Guatemala (whose monetary unit is the quetzal).

The head and breast of the male quetzal are brilliant gold-green. Its back is blue with a curly gold-tinged mantle, and its belly is crimson. Its head has a rounded hairlike crest. The female’s colors are much less bright. The wings of the bird are rounded, the legs short, and the feet weak. Uniquely, the second (inner) toe points backward. The bill is short, curved, and broad and has bristles at the base. The eye is ringed with colorful bare skin. Long blue-green plumes cover the bird’s tail, which shows white beneath in flight. The male resplendent quetzal is adorned with a train that can be more than 3 feet (1 meter) long—more than twice as long as its body.

Quetzals build their nests in holes they dig in decaying tree trunks or logs. They typically lay two eggs, which are pale blue and nearly spherical. Incubation takes about 17 to 18 days. The parental duties are fully shared between the male and female bird.

Quetzals belong to the genus Pharomachrus of the trogon family, Trogonidae. The resplendent quetzal is P. mocinno.
