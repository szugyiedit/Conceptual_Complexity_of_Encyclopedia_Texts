The bird called the domestic pigeon is a familiar sight on city streets. It is only one species, or type, of pigeon. About 250 species of pigeons and doves are found around the world. These birds make up the scientific family Columbidae. Often the larger members of the family are called pigeons, and the smaller ones are called doves. But there is no clear distinction between the names. For example, the traditional “dove of peace” is a white domestic pigeon.

Pigeons and doves are found nearly all over the world. They live in farmlands, woodlands, deserts, and cities.

These birds have plump bodies with short necks, small heads, and long wings. They range in length from about 6 to 33 inches (15 to 84 centimeters). Many of them are gray, brown, black, or white. They are strong fliers. On the ground a pigeon or dove struts about, bobbing its head up and down.

Most pigeons and doves eat mainly seeds, which they pick up from the ground. Some types eat leaves or fruit.

Pigeons and doves are the only birds to feed their young a liquid called milk. Both parents produce the “milk” from a gland in the throat. The parents typically stay together for as long as they live.

Pigeons and doves have an excellent sense of direction. For thousands of years people have trained pigeons to carry messages over long distances. A trained bird can find its way home after being carried hundreds of miles away.

People also hunt pigeons and doves for sport. Hunters killed so many passenger pigeons that this type became extinct, or died out. The last one died in 1914. Since then people have tried to limit the numbers of birds hunted.

The Old World rock dove has been bred since 3000 BC.
