Kookaburras are birds that belong to the kingfisher family. One type is known as the laughing kookaburra because its call sounds like a person laughing.

The most common kookaburras live in Australia in woodland areas and open forests. A few types live on the nearby island of New Guinea. Kookaburras nest in large holes in tree trunks or termite mounds.

The laughing kookaburra is the largest of the kingfishers. It can reach a length of about 17 inches (43 centimeters). The other kookaburras are slightly smaller. All kookaburras have a large head and long bill. The bill is dark above and cream colored underneath. The body is cream colored with brown markings. As its name suggests, the blue-winged kookaburra has blue on its wings. The males have a blue tail.

Kookaburras use their large bills to catch snakes, large lizards, worms, snails, insects, frogs, and rodents. The birds kill the larger prey by bashing it against a tree or a rock.

After kookaburras mate, the female lays up to four eggs in the nest. The females and others help incubate the eggs. They sit on them to protect them and keep them warm for about 24 days before the eggs hatch. The young are fully grown after about a year. They often remain with the parents and help raise the next yearâ€™s brood. Kookaburras may live as long as 20 years.
