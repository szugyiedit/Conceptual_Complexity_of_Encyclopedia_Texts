The best-known icterid of this name is the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), ranging from Canada to the West Indies and Central America. It is 20 cm long, and the male’s black plumage is set off by red shoulder patches. All-black icterids in North America are the rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) and Brewer’s blackbird (E. cyanocephalus). The red-breasted blackbird (Leistes militaris), common over most of South America, is one of the so-called military blackbirds (also called, erroneously, starlings), or marshbirds.
