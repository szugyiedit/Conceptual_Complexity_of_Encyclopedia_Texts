Magpies are bold, noisy birds with long tails that belong to the group of birds known as songbirds. The magpieâ€™s voice, however, is rather harsh sounding. Magpies are known for their intelligence, often hiding objects and then remembering where to find them. There are several different types of magpies; they belong to the family Corvidae (order Passeriformes), along with crows, ravens, and jays.

Magpies are found in many parts of the world but are most common in the Northern Hemisphere. These birds build their nests in tall trees, yet they need open grasslands for feeding, so they are often found at the edges of forests. Magpies eat insects, dead animals, fruit, seeds, and even the eggs and young of other birds. When magpies have had enough to eat, they hide the leftovers to eat later.

Two of the best-known species are the common, or Eurasian, magpie (Pica pica) and the black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia). They are black-and-white birds with iridescent blue-green wings and tail. They reach a length of about 18 inches (45 centimeters). Common magpies are found throughout Europe and in northwestern Africa and much of Asia. The black-billed magpie inhabits western North America and is noted for making a large round nest of twigs cemented with mud. Several types of magpie found mainly in Asia have bright blue or green feathers.
