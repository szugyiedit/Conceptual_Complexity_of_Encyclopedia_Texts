Kingfishers are generally brightly colored birds that often fish for their food. There are about 90 kinds of kingfisher throughout the world. Most of these live in warm regions near rivers or lakes.

Kingfishers have plump bodies that are about 4 to 18 inches (10 to 46 centimeters) long. Their feathers come in many colors. Many kingfishers have blue feathers on their back and reddish or white feathers on their belly. Some have a crest, or tuft of upright feathers, on top of their head. A kingfisherâ€™s short tail allows the bird to turn easily when it is underwater. The dagger-like bill is useful for spearing fish, insects, and other food.

Kingfishers hunt for fish by swooping down and diving into the water. Sometimes they hunt on land for lizards and insects. Kingfishers are also known for chasing and attacking each other in the air.

Kingfishers spend their time alone until it is time to mate. During the mating season, the birds pair up to build nests for their eggs. They make nests in the hollows of trees or dig tunnels in banks of earth. After the eggs hatch, the parents raise their young together. When the babies are old enough, the parents go off on their own again. Kingfishers can live as long as 20 years.
