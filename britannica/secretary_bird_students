Unlike nearly all other birds of prey, the secretary bird lives and hunts primarily on the ground. It is best known as a killer of snakes. In its native home in the dry uplands of Africa, it is sometimes kept around farms to catch snakes, rodents, reptiles, and large insects. The secretary bird hunts on foot and kills its prey by kicking, stamping, or flailing it against the ground. The bird is very agile, and with its long legs it can deliver blows from a safe distance. If its prey does not succumb, the bird may snatch the animal, take flight, and drop it from aloft. In most African nations, the birds are protected by law.

The secretary bird is so named because the tuft of stiff feathers that projects from the back of its head and neck makes it look like an old-time secretary with a bunch of quill pens stuck behind an ear. The bird’s body—about 4 feet (1.2 meters) long with a 7-foot (2.1-meter) wingspread—is slender but powerful. It is light gray, with short black “trousers” and black-tipped wings. Its legs have thick scales to protect the bird from snakebites. It has a large, eaglelike bill that is strong and hooked.

The birds’ nests are bulky platforms of sticks, weeds, and grasses placed in low, usually thorny trees or bushes. The scientific name of the secretary bird is Sagittarius serpentarius. (See also bird of prey.)
