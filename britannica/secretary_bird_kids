The secretary bird is a large bird of prey. Unlike nearly all other birds of prey, the secretary bird lives and hunts on the ground. The scientific name of the secretary bird is Sagittarius serpentarius.

Secretary birds are found only in Africa, usually in the grasslands south of the Sahara. They are protected by law in most countries in Africa.

Secretary birds have long legs. Their bodies are slim but very strong. Secretary birds can grow to be 4 feet (1 meter) tall and have a wingspan as wide as 7 feet (2 meters). Although secretary birds can fly, they prefer to stay on the ground.

The secretary bird has stiff black feathers that stick out from the back of its head and neck. It is called the secretary bird because its tuft of black feathers makes the bird look as if it were carrying quill pens behind its ears, as secretaries once did. The body feathers are light gray. The thigh and wing feathers are black, with white on the outside of the wings. The secretary bird has two long tail feathers.

Secretary birds hunt snakes. They can do this because their legs have thick scales that protect them from snakebites. Secretary birds kill snakes by stamping on them or hitting them against the ground. Sometimes they kill snakes by dropping them from the sky. Secretary birds also eat lizards, grasshoppers, mice, and birdsâ€™ eggs.

Secretary birds build large nests in thorny bushes or trees that are low to the ground. Their nests are made of sticks, weeds, and grass. Usually two eggs hatch at the same time. Both parents look after the chicks and feed them.
