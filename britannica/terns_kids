The slim, graceful birds known as terns can fly great distances. The Arctic tern makes a longer annual migration than any other bird—a round trip of about 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) between the Arctic and Antarctica. Enjoying the long summer days in both regions, this tern sees more daylight than any other creature on Earth.

There are about 40 species, or kinds, of terns. Among them are the common tern, the royal tern, the black tern, the sooty tern, and the noddy terns. Their closest relatives are the gulls.

Terns can be found by seacoasts and inland waters in most parts of the world. Many different kinds of terns can be found in the Pacific Ocean region.

Terns range in length from about 8 to 23 inches (20 to 58 centimeters). Their feathers are white, black, or gray. Some are strikingly patterned in black and white. A tern’s sharply pointed bill may be black, red, or yellow. Its small, webbed feet may be red or black. A tern’s tail tends to be long and forked.

Terns hover over water and plunge down to feed on small fish and shellfish. They are not great swimmers, though, so they stay in the water only long enough to catch a mouthful of food.

Terns are social animals. Thousands of them may nest in the same area. Terns make their nests on the ground. Some make nests of grass, while others simply scrape out a shallow hole in sandy soil. Female terns lay one to three eggs at a time. Both parents take turns keeping the eggs warm. The eggs hatch in less than a month. Four to eight weeks later, the young birds are ready to fly.
