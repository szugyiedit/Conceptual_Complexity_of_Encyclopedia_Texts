The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is the only eagle solely native to North America. It is also the national bird of the United States. Like all hawks and eagles, the bald eagle is a bird of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae of the order Falconiformes.

The bald eagle is actually a sea eagle that commonly occurs inland along rivers and large lakes. The adult male is about 36 inches (90 centimeters) long and has a wingspan of 6.6 feet (2 meters). Females grow somewhat larger than males and may reach 43 inches (108 centimeters) in length and have a wingspan of 8 feet (2.5 meters). Both sexes are dark brown, with a white head and tail. The bird is not actually bald; its name comes from its strikingly noticeable white-feathered head. The beak, eyes, and feet are yellow.

Bald eagles pluck fish out of the water with their talons, and sometimes they follow seabirds as a means of locating fish. Bald eagles also rob ospreys of their fish. Besides live fish, bald eagles prey on other birds, small mammals, snakes, turtles, and crabs. They also eat dead animals.


The bald eagle’s nest is a large platform of sticks built atop a large, isolated tree or pinnacle of rock located within easy flight of water. A female lays two or three eggs, which take slightly longer than a month to hatch. Both parents share in the incubation and feeding of the young. The immature birds are brown with whitish tail and wing linings. The pure white head and tail feathers do not appear until the birds are four to five years old.

Because of overhunting and the adverse effects of the agricultural pesticide DDT, bald eagles were placed on the U.S. government’s list of endangered species in 1978. Conservation measures, however, helped the birds to replenish their numbers in the wild. In 2007 the bald eagle was removed from the list of endangered and threatened species.
