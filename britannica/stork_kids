Storks are large birds with long legs, necks, and bills. They are wading birds, which means they typically walk or stand in shallow water while feeding. There are 17 species, or types, of stork. The most famous type is the white stork. In some European countries it is said to bring good luck. Storks are related to herons, ibises, flamingos, and New World vultures.

Most storks live in warm regions in Africa, Asia, and Europe. They can also be found in the Americas and Australia. The only stork commonly seen in the United States is the wood stork. It breeds in the Southeast and sometimes wanders farther north. Storks tend to live near water, but they can also be found on dry ground. The white stork is known for nesting on rooftops and chimneys in towns.

Storks usually stand about 2 to 5 feet (0.6 to 1.5 meters) tall. The largest stork is the marabou of Africa. Storks commonly have black and white feathers. Some species have no feathers on the head and neck, only red, pink, or black skin.

Most storks eat insects, frogs, fish, and other small animals. They catch their food in fields or shallow waters. The marabou and a type called the adjutant stork feed on carrion, or dead animals.

The stories about storks bringing good luck have led many people to treat the birds well. In some places, however, storks have been hunted and killed for food or for their feathers.
