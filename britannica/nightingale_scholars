nightingale, any of several small Old World thrushes, belonging to the family Turdidae (order Passeriformes), renowned for their song. The name refers in particular to the Eurasian nightingale (Erithacus, or Luscinia, megarhynchos), a brown bird, 16 centimetres (61/2 inches) long, with a rufous tail. Its strong and varied song, in which crescendo effects are prominent, is uttered by day or night from perches in shrubbery.

The thrush nightingale, or sprosser (E. luscinia), is a closely related, somewhat more northerly species with slightly darker plumage. Its song lacks the crescendo.

The term nightingale is also applied to other birds with rich songs, such as members of the neotropical nightingale thrush group, the Chinese nightingale (see Leiothrix), and, in the West Indies, the mockingbird.
