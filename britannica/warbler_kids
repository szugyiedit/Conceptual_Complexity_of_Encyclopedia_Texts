The warbler is a small songbird. It eats insects and is found in gardens, woodlands, and marshes. There are two groups of warblers: the Old World warblers and the New World warblers, which are also called woodwarblers.

Old World warblers are found mainly from Europe and Asia to Australia and Africa. Very few of these birds live in the Americas. Many European warblers have been given special names, such as the blackcap, whitethroat, and chiffchaff.

The New World warblers, or woodwarblers, are mainly found in North and Central America and live in forest, brush, or swampy grass country. The best-known New World warbler is the yellow warbler. It is found from Alaska and Newfoundland to the West Indies, Peru, and the Galápagos Islands. It is sometimes mistakenly called the wild canary.

Old World warblers are rather drab. They are generally green, olive, brown, buff, or black. They are mostly small birds, from 31/2 to 10 inches (9 to 25 centimeters) in length. Their slender bills are adapted for capturing insects from plants and shrubs.

The New World warblers are also small birds, ranging up to 7 inches (18 centimeters) in length. They are more brightly colored than Old World warblers. Many New World warblers have weak, quiet songs, but a few have loud voices.

The warblers’ nests are usually placed in trees, bushes, grass, or hidden in the ground. They usually lay from two to five eggs, which are speckled. Both parents care for the young.
