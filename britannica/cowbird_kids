As their name suggests, cowbirds often live among cattle and other large mammals. They feed on insects stirred up as these animals graze. Cowbirds are songbirds that are related to grackles, orioles, meadowlarks, and most types of blackbird.

Cowbirds are common in North America. The best-known species, or type, is the brown-headed cowbird. Another species, the bay-winged cowbird, lives in South America.

Most male cowbirds have shiny black feathers, while the females are usually grayish brown. Male brown-headed cowbirds have brown heads and black bodies.

Bay-winged cowbirds are the only cowbirds that build their own nests. Most cowbird species lay their eggs in the nests of other types of birds. These other birds then sit on the cowbird eggs along with their own. When a cowbird chick hatches, the host birds often feed and care for it as if it were their own. Cowbird chicks tend to hatch a day or two before the other birds. They also grow quickly. These facts give them an advantage over the other birds when it comes to being fed.
