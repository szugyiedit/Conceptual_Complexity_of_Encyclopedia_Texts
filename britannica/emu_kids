The emu is a large bird that cannot fly. There were once several types of emu, but over the course of many years humans hunted and killed off all but one type.

Emus live in Australia in most parts of the country. They even live near cities. They need shrubs or trees for their food, however, so they do not live in open areas with no plants. They eat seeds, fruits, flowers, insects, and leaves.

Emus are more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall and may weigh more than 100 pounds (45 kilograms). Females are slightly heavier than males. Emus are the second largest type of bird, after ostriches. They have stout bodies and long legs. Their coloring is brownish, with dark gray head and neck. Emus can run nearly 30 miles (50 kilometers) per hour; if cornered they kick with their big, three-toed feet.

After emus mate, the female lays 5 to 15 dark green eggs in a ground nest. The male then incubates the eggs, meaning that it sits on them to protect and keep them warm, for about 60 days until they hatch. Emus are fully grown by about 2 years of age. They live for about 5 to 10 years.
