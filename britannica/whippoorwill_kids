he whippoorwill is a North American bird that is nocturnal, or active at night. It is named for its call—three whistled notes that sound like “whip-poor-will.” It may repeat this call 400 times without stopping.

Whippoorwills are in the same scientific family as nightjars and nighthawks. They are also related to owls. The scientific name of the whippoorwill is Caprimulgus vociferus.

Whippoorwills live in woodlands. They can be found in southeastern Canada, in the eastern and southwestern United States, and in Mexico. They may spend the winter as far south as Costa Rica.

The whippoorwill is about 9.5 inches (24 centimeters) long. It has spotted brownish and grayish feathers. The bird has very short legs and large eyes. Its bill is small, but its mouth can open very wide. The corners of the male’s tail are white. The male also has a thin band of white feathers around the neck.

Around dawn and dusk the whippoorwill swoops across the sky, searching for insects to eat. By day it sleeps on the forest floor or perches lengthwise on a branch.
