Swans are waterbirds with heavy bodies and long necks. They swim gracefully, seeming to glide across the water. They are also strong fliers. Along with ducks and geese, swans belong to a family of birds called waterfowl in North America and wildfowl in Europe. Swans are the largest and least common of the waterfowl.

Swans are found on or near water. Most types migrate, or fly long distances to spend different seasons in different regions.

Five species, or types, of swan live in the northern parts of Europe, Asia, or North America. They include the mute swan, the trumpeter swan, and the whistling swan, which is also called the tundra swan. All five northern species are white.

Three species of swans are found in southern regions. The black swan lives in Australia. Two types are found in southern South America: the black-necked swan and the coscoroba.

Swans are among the larger flying birds. The trumpeter swan is the largest waterfowl. It can reach 5.5 feet (1.7 meters) in length. The mute swan is also very large and heavy.

Like the other waterfowl, swans have webbed feet. This gives them extra paddling power in the water. Waterfowl also have a gland that makes oil. The oil helps protect their feathers from water. An inner layer of soft feathers called down helps the birds stay warm.

Swans use their long necks to pluck plants from below the surface of the water. They also eat seeds, small water creatures, and fish eggs.
