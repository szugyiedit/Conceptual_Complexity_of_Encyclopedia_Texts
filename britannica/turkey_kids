Turkeys are large birds. They are found in the wild and they are also raised for food. The two species, or types, of turkey are the common turkey and the ocellated turkey.

The common turkey prefers places with mild temperatures. It usually has black feathers mixed with a shiny green or bronze color. The head and neck are featherless, bumpy, and bright red. Males have a piece of red skin growing from the forehead. Male turkeys often make a gobbling sound while females make a clicking noise.

Some common turkeys live in the wild. They are found in Mexico and parts of the southern United States. Wild turkeys prefer forests and swamps. Males weigh about 22 pounds (10 kilograms), but females are much smaller. Wild turkeys can fly but only for short distances.

Many common turkeys are kept on farms and raised for food. These turkeys are usually heavier, and they cannot fly. Their feathers are usually white.

The ocellated turkey is found in Central America. It is much smaller than the common turkey. It has a blue head and neck with reddish yellow bumps. Its tail feathers are tipped with blue and gold, somewhat like a peacock. The ocellated turkey is not raised for food.
