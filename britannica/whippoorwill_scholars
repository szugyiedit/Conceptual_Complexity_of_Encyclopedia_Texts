whippoorwill, (Caprimulgus vociferus), nocturnal bird of North America belonging to the family Caprimulgidae (see caprimulgiform) and closely resembling the related common nightjar of Europe. It is named for its vigorous deliberate call (first and third syllables accented), which it may repeat 400 times without stopping. It lives in woods near open country, where it hawks for insects around dusk and dawn; by day it sleeps on the forest floor or perches lengthwise on a branch. About 24 cm (9 1/2 inches) long, it has mottled brownish plumage with, in the male, a white collar and white tail corners; the female’s tail is plain and her collar is buffy.

The whippoorwill breeds from southeastern Canada throughout the eastern United States and from the southwestern United States throughout Mexico, wintering as far south as Costa Rica. In the middle of its range it is often confused with the chuck-will’s-widow and the poorwill.
