rhea, either of two species of large, flightless birds in the family Rheidae, order Rheiformes. They are native to South America and are related to the ostrich and emu. The common rhea (Rhea americana) is found in open country from northeastern Brazil southward to Argentina, while Darwin’s rhea (Pterocnemia pennata) lives from Peru southward to Patagonia, at the tip of the continent. Both species are considerably smaller than the ostrich; the common rhea stands about 120 cm (4 feet) tall and weighs about 20 kg (50 pounds). The common rhea has brown or gray upper parts and whitish underparts, while Darwin’s rhea is somewhat smaller in size, and its brownish plumage is tipped with white.

Rheas are distinguished from ostriches by their three-toed feet (those of the ostrich have two), their lack of fine plumes, and their brownish colour. The birds frequent open, treeless country and evade predators by running. They are omnivorous and can utilize a wide variety of plant and animal foods. Rheas do not form lasting pairs, and males incubate the eggs and raise the young. Moreover, the birds are polygamous, i.e., the male broods the eggs of several females laid in one nest. The females lay up to 50 eggs—about 13 cm (5 inches) long—in a shallow, grass-lined nest dug by a male in the ground. He then incubates the eggs, and the chicks hatch in about 6 weeks and are herded about by the male for another 6 weeks thereafter. Rheas frequently associate with deer or guanacos, forming mixed herds like those of ostriches, zebras, and antelopes.
