The kiwi is a small, flightless bird found in New Zealand. The name is a Maori word referring to the shrill call of the male. Kiwis are related to the extinct, ostrichlike flightless moas. There are five species of kiwis, and they belong to the genus Apteryx.

Kiwis are grayish brown birds the size of a chicken. The birds exhibit many unusual traits. The wings are small and are hidden within the feathers, which are soft and hairlike. Kiwis have long, flexible bills with the nostrils at the tip rather than the base like most birds. The legs are stout and muscular, and each of the four toes has a large claw. In addition, the kiwi’s eyes are small and inefficient in full daylight, and long bristles, perhaps useful for the bird’s sense of touch, occur at the base of the bill.

Kiwis live in forests. The birds are nocturnal, sleeping by day in burrows. At night, they forage for food, including worms, insects and their larvae, and berries. Kiwis can run swiftly when required; when trapped they use their claws in defense.

One or two large white eggs—up to 1 pound (450 grams) in weight—are laid in a burrow and are incubated by the male for about 80 days. The egg is, relative to the size of the bird, the largest of any living species. The chick hatches fully feathered and with its eyes open; it does not eat for about a week.

The genus Apteryx forms the family Apterygidae. Five species of kiwis are recognized: the tokoeka kiwi (A. australis), which is divided into several subspecies; the little spotted kiwi (A. oweni); the great spotted kiwi (A. haasti); the Okarito brown kiwi (A. rowi), also called the Rowi kiwi; and the brown kiwi (A. mantelli), also called the North Island brown kiwi.
