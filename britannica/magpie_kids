Magpies are bold, noisy birds that have many calls. They belong to a group of birds called songbirds. However, their voices are rather harsh sounding. Like their relatives the crows, magpies are known for their intelligence. For instance, magpies hide objects and then remember where to find them again. People often keep these birds as pets.

Magpies are in the same family as crows, ravens, and jays. There are several different species, or types, of magpie. Common types include the Eurasian magpie and the black-billed magpie.

Magpies live in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. These birds build nests in tall trees. However, they need open grasslands nearby for feeding. Thus they are often found at the edges of forests.

Eurasian and black-billed magpies are about 18 inches (46 centimeters) long. They are mostly black except for their white bellies and white patches on their wings. They have long black tails. In sunlight their wings and tails look shiny blue or green. Several types of magpie found mainly in Asia have bright blue or green feathers.

Magpies eat many different kinds of food. They eat insects, dead animals, fruit, seeds, and even the eggs and chicks of other birds. When magpies have too much to eat all at once, they stash food away to eat later.
