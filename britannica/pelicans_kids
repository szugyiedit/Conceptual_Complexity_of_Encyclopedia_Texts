Pelicans are among the largest flying birds. They are famous for their huge throat pouches. A pelican uses its pouch and its very long bill to scoop up fish.

Pelicans live around lakes, rivers, and seacoasts in many parts of the world. They often fish and fly in small groups. They breed in very large groups on islands.

Scientists classify pelicans in the genus, or group, called Pelecanus. There are several different species, or types, of pelican. They are related to cormorants and gannets.

Most pelicans have mainly white feathers. The best-known types are the North American white pelican and the European white pelican. The brown pelican is darker. In all types the throat pouch does not have any feathers.

Some kinds of pelican can be more than 70 inches (180 centimeters) long. They may weigh more than 30 pounds (13 kilograms). Pelicans have long wingspreads. Their wings can sometimes stretch more than 9 feet (2.7 meters) from tip to tip. This makes them good flyers. Their webbed feet helps them swim. However, their short legs make them look clumsy on land.

Pelicans eat several pounds of fish each day. Swimming pelicans often line up in a group and herd fish into shallow waters. From there the birds can easily scoop up the fish. The brown pelican fishes in a different way. It makes plunging dives from high above the water.
