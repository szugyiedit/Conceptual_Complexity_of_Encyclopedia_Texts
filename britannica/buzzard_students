buzzards are any of several species of birds of prey that belong to the genus Buteo. In addition, in North America various New World vultures (family Cathartidae), especially the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), are considered buzzards. Similarly, in Australia a large hawk of the genus Hamirostra is called a black-breasted buzzard. In North America, Buteo species are called buteos, buzzard hawks, or simply hawks.

True buzzards, or buteos, constitute the subfamily Buteoninae of the family Accipitridae. When in flight, true buzzards can usually be distinguished from other birds of prey by their broad wings and expansive rounded tails. Their wingspan may be anywhere between 48 and 60 inches (120 to 150 centimeters). These birds fly with slow heavy wing beats and soar gracefully. The feathers of most species is essentially dark brown above and white or mottled brown below, and the tail and underside of the wings usually are striped. There are many differences of color, however, even between individuals of a single species. Buzzards customarily prey on insects and small mammals but occasionally attack birds. The nest, in a tree or on a cliff, is built of sticks and lined with softer materials. Two to five eggs, whitish in color with blotches of brown, are produced.

The best-known species, the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), is found from Scandinavia south to the Mediterranean. Other species range over much of North America, Eurasia, and northern Africa. Buzzards generally live in hills, wooded valleys, and farmland with scattered woods.
