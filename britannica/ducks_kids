Introduction

The waterbirds called ducks are related to geese and swans. There are about 100 species, or types, of duck. They are found almost all over the world. Many types migrate, or fly long distances to spend different seasons in different regions. People keep ducks for their meat, eggs, and feathers. Some hunters shoot ducks for sport.

Physical Features

Ducks, geese, and swans are called waterfowl in North America and wildfowl in Europe. These birds have stout bodies and webbed feet. Soft inner feathers called down protect them from cold. A gland near the tail produces oil. This oil helps protect the outer feathers from water.

Ducks are the smallest of the waterfowl. For instance, the mallard is a fairly large duck at about 24 inches (61 centimeters) long. Ducksâ€™ legs are set far back on their bodies. This helps them swim well but makes them waddle when walking.

Female ducks have mainly brown or gray feathers year-round. The males look like the females for part of the year. But most males have more colorful feathers during the breeding season. For example, breeding male mallards have shiny green heads.

Behaviour

Many types of duck feed at the water surface. They dip their heads below the surface while tipping up their tails. These ducks are called dabbling ducks. They eat mainly plants and insects. They include mallards, black ducks, teals, pintails, and shovelers.

Many ducks nest on the ground near water. Perching ducks are dabbling ducks that nest in trees. They include the wood duck and the mandarin duck.

Ducks that dive deep into the water are called diving ducks. Some types eat mostly fish and live on the open seas. These sea ducks include mergansers, scoters, and eiders. Other diving ducks stay close to shore.
