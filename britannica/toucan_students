The toucan is any of about 34 species of large-billed, tropical American birds constituting the family Ramphastidae. The toucan has a mainly black body with bold breast color, a saw-edged, distinctly colored bill, short, rounded wings, and a long tail. The toucan can grow to 2 feet (0.6 meter) long. They nest in noisy treetop colonies in tree holes and lay 2 to 4 glossy white eggs in the unlined cavity of trees. Toucans feed on fruit, large insects, lizards, and nestling birds. Members include the red-breasted toucan (Ramphastos dicolorus) of Amazonia, the collared aracari (Pteroglossus torquatus) of southern Mexico and Venezuela, and the emerald toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus) of Brazil, Mexico, and the Andes.
