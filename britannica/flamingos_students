The flamingo is a long-legged bird that is usually a rich vermilion color, shading on the underparts to rose and pale pink. It stands between 3 to 6.5 feet (0.9 to 2 meters) tall. The bird’s neck curves, looking very much like a letter S. Its head is small, and its beak is flat and downcurved. The flamingo flies with its neck and legs outstretched. The sight of a colony of hundreds of these birds taking to the sky and streaking it with color is not soon forgotten.

Mollusks of the genus Ceritheum are a favorite food of some flamingos. The flamingo gets the mollusks by plunging its head into water and mud, twisting it upside down, and scooping up the mollusks with its upper beak. The feeding bird forces out sand and mud taken in with the food through ridges along the sides of the beak.

The American scarlet flamingo, known scientifically as Phoenicopterus ruber, is becoming increasingly rare. It lives in the Bahamas, Cuba, Haiti, and along the coasts of Central and South America from Yucatán to Brazil and Chile.

Flamingos nest in colonies on coastal salt mud flats. The nest is a truncated cone of claylike mud piled up a few inches in a shallow lagoon. The female usually lays a single egg, and her mate helps her hatch it in about 30 days. The young are covered with white down. At first the bill is straight. Then it gradually takes a downward curve. In zoological gardens flamingos often lose their bright colors, but these can be restored by proper feeding. The most famous collections of captive birds are the large breeding colonies at the Hialeah Park racetrack and at Parrot Jungle in Miami, Florida.
