 The nocturnal whippoorwill won its name by its call. As the whippoorwill swoops across the sky hunting insects, it keeps calling three whistled notes—whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will— which may be repeated 400 times without stopping.

It is harder to see a whippoorwill than to hear one. In the daytime the bird, about 10 inches (25 centimeters) long, sleeps on the ground where its spotted plumage blends with the surroundings (see protective coloration) or perches lengthwise on a branch. Whippoorwills summer in the Eastern United States and Canada and winter in the Gulf states, Mexico, and Central America. They belong to the goatsucker family Caprimulgidae. The scientific name of the whippoorwill is Caprimulgus vociferus.
