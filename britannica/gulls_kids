The waterbirds called gulls can be found nearly all around the world. They are commonly heard screaming and seen swooping over the water at seacoasts and lakeshores. Gulls can fly, swim along the water surface, and walk well.

There are more than 40 species, or types, of gull, including kittiwakes. Gulls belong to the scientific family Laridae, along with terns. Terns are similar to gulls in many ways. However, terns tend to be smaller and more slender than gulls. Terns also have shorter legs, longer wings, and straighter bills.

Adult gulls are usually white or gray, sometimes with dark markings. They range in length from about 11 to 31 inches (28 to 79 centimeters). Their long wings help them glide. Wingspreads range from about 24 inches (61 centimeters) in the little gull to about 65 inches (165 centimeters) in the great black-backed gull. A gull’s bill is strong and slightly hooked. Its webbed feet help it swim.

A gull’s favorite food is fish. Gulls can land on the water to feed or rest. These birds also eat a great variety of other foods, including shellfish, insects, worms, mice, birds’ eggs, dead and rotting animals, and even garbage.

Gulls migrate, meaning that they spend different seasons in different places. Some gulls fly great distances, across the ocean or over land, between their summer and winter homes.
