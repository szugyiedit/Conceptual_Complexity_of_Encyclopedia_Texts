Cardinals are American songbirds known for the maleâ€™s bright red feathers. Both the male and the female sing a loud, clear whistling song year-round. The northern cardinal is one of the most common birds of North America. It is related to finches, grosbeaks, and many types of sparrows. Other species, or types, of cardinals live in South America.

Northern cardinals are found mainly in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, in southeastern Canada, and in Mexico. These birds do not fly south for the winter. Instead they spend the entire year in the same area. They live in bushes, in gardens, and at the edges of woodlands.

The northern cardinal is about 8 inches (20 centimeters) long. It has a pointed tuft of feathers, called a crest, on top of its head. The males are red with black face markings and red crests. The females have gray-brown backs. Their wings, tails, and crests are a dull red.

All cardinals have strong, cone-shaped bills. This helps them crush the seeds they eat. Cardinals also eat many kinds of insects and fruits.
