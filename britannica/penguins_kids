Introduction

Penguins are the only birds that can swim but cannot fly. These black and white seabirds move about very easily in the water. On land they stand upright and waddle about.

Where Penguins Live

There are 18 species, or types, of penguins. They are found mainly in the southern half of the world. Many types are found in the cold regions of Antarctica or nearby islands. Penguins also live along the cool coasts of Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and South America. The Galápagos penguin lives in a warm region off the coast of Ecuador.

Physical Features

A penguin typically has a black back and a white belly. Different types range in height from about 14–45 inches (36–114 centimeters). The largest type is the emperor penguin, which weighs about 80 pounds (36 kilograms).

Penguins are excellent swimmers and divers. They can swim faster than 25 miles (40 kilometers) per hour. Penguins use their short, paddlelike wings as flippers for swimming. Their feet are webbed, and their bodies are shaped like torpedoes. Penguins have short legs, but they can run fairly quickly. To travel over ice and snow, a penguin may slide on its belly.

A penguin is covered nearly all over with short feathers. The feathers keep water out and trap warm air against the skin. A thick layer of fat also protects this bird from the cold.

Behaviour

Penguins dive after small sea animals to eat. Different types eat small fishes, squid, and shrimplike animals called krill.

Penguins breed in large groups called nesting colonies. Some types travel long distances to reach their nesting colonies. They may return to the same nesting place year after year.
