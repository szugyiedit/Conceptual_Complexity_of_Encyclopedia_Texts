Peacocks are known for their huge fans of colorful tail feathers, called a train. People have kept these beautiful blue and green birds for thousands of years. Sometimes the word peacock is used to describe only the male bird. The female is called a peahen.

Peacocks belong to the pheasant family, Phasianidae. There are three species, or types, of peacock—the blue (or Indian) peacock, the green (or Javanese) peacock, and the Congo peacock. The only peacocks that have trains of tail feathers are the males of the blue and green types.

Peacocks usually live in lowland forests. At night they sleep in trees. The blue peacock comes from southern Asia, while the green peacock comes from southeastern Asia. The Congo peacock is found in central Africa.

In both the blue and green types, the male’s body is about 35 to 50 inches (90 to 130 centimeters) long. Its train of metallic green tail feathers is about 60 inches (150 centimeters) long. Each tail feather has a shining spot at the end of the feather that looks like an eye. A crest, or tuft of feathers, tops the male’s head. The peahen of both these species is green and brown. It is almost as big as the male.

Male blue and green peacocks put on a showy display when trying to attract mates. The peacock lifts its train and spreads it like a fan. It then struts about and shakes its train, making the feathers shimmer and rustle.

The Congo peacock is mainly blue and green. Its tail is short and rounded. The peahen is reddish and green.

Peacocks molt, or lose their feathers, every year toward the end of summer.
