 The kingfisher family of birds, Alcedinidae, includes some 90 species, distributed over the greater part of the globe. They are known for their swift dives. From its perch the kingfisher can swoop like an arrow to seize a fish underwater or an insect on land. An ancient name for the kingfisher was halcyon.

The most common species of kingfisher in North America is the belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon). It nests from northern Canada to the Gulf coast and winters in the central and southern parts of the United States. The bird is 11 to 14 inches (28 to 35 centimeters) long and has a shaggy, black crest. Its feathers are bluish gray on the upper parts and white on the underparts. The male has a gray belt of breast feathers. The female has a chestnut belt. The belted kingfisher nests in holes that it digs in banks beside lakes and streams. The eggs are laid in groups of five to eight on a bed of fish bones. The kingfisherâ€™s call is a loud rattle.

The kingfisher family is most numerous in the East Indies, where there are many vividly colored species. Kingfishers also occur in Europe, Central and South America, Africa, and Asia Minor. The kookaburra (Dacelo gigas) of Australia is also in the kingfisher family. Its call sounds like fiendish laughter.
