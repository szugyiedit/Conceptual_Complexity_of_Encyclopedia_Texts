The chicken is a bird that people all over the world raise for its meat, eggs, and feathers. It belongs to the group of domesticated, or tame, birds called poultry.

Chickens have short wings and a heavy body. This makes it hard for them to fly very far. Male chickens are called roosters. Roosters often have brightly colored feathers. They can be red, green, brown, black, or other colors. Female chickens are called hens. Hens are usually brown or white. Both males and females have one or two wattles. A wattle is skin that hangs from the throat. Male and female chickens also have a comb, which is skin that sticks up from the top of the head.

Farmers usually keep chickens inside large, modern buildings. They feed the birds corn and other grains. Some farmers allow their chickens to roam free outdoors. These chickens usually roost, or sleep, inside at night.

Hens can lay more than 200 eggs a year. If a hen mates with a rooster before laying eggs, the eggs will be fertilized. This means that they will develop into chicks. But hens can lay eggs without mating. These unfertilized eggs are the eggs that people eat.

Wild birds called jungle fowl are the ancestors of chickens. Jungle fowl belong to the pheasant family. They live in parts of Asia, including India. Jungle fowl eat seeds, fruit, and insects. They fly into trees to escape from predators.
