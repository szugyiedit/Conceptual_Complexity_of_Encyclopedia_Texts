Certain birds in the cuckoo family are called roadrunners. Roadrunners can fly, but they are rather clumsy in flight and get tired quickly. They prefer to dash around on their powerful legs. A roadrunner sometimes reaches speeds of more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) per hour. While running, it stretches out its neck, spreads out its short wings, and jerks its long tail up and down.

There are two kinds of roadrunners. The greater roadrunner lives in Mexico and the southwestern United States. The lesser roadrunner is found in Mexico and Central America. Most roadrunners live in deserts and other open areas without many trees.

The greater roadrunner is about 22 inches (56 centimeters) long. Its feathers are streaked in olive-brown and white. The lesser roadrunner is somewhat smaller and less streaked. Both kinds have a short tuft of shaggy feathers, called a crest, on the head.

Roadrunners chase and catch lizards, snakes, mice, and insects for food. A roadrunner often holds an animal in its bill and pounds it to death against rocks.
