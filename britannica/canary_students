One of the most popular pet songbirds all over the world is the canary. In the wild, this member of the finch family measures about 5 1/2 inches (14 centimeters) in length. It is dull green above, with a yellow breast.

The canary species originated on the Canary, Madeira, and Azores islands in the Mediterranean. The birds became prized as pets in the 16th century when they were first brought from the Canary Islands to Italy. Through a special breeding process some 50 varieties have been produced. These varieties differ in size, form, plumage, and song from their wild kin.

The American Singer is a very popular variety. It is usually yellow, and its song is strong, melodious, and very free. The raising of roller canaries is an important industry in the Harz Mountains in Germany. In breeding rollers all attention is directed to the development of song. Rollers sing quietly (with their mouths closed) as compared to other types. Their songs are very controlled and complex.

The development of color and form has been the object of many breeders in the United States, France, Belgium, England, and Scotland. One of the most graceful breeds is the Yorkshire canary, with its long slim body. Quite different is the plump Norwich.

The lizard canary is noted for its beautifully mottled feathers. The Scots fancy is an odd bent-over, crescent-shaped creature. The Belgian is a great humpbacked bird with massive shoulders.

The average life span of a caged canary is 10 to 15 years. The scientific name of the canary is Serinus canaria. (For care and feeding of canaries see pets.)
