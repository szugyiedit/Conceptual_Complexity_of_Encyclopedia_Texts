Falcons are birds of prey, meaning that they hunt and eat animals for food. They are related to hawks and eagles. Falcons are swift, powerful fliers. A sport called falconry dates back to ancient times. It involves training falcons to hunt animals in cooperation with humans. Some common kinds of falcons include the peregrine falcon, the merlin, and several types of kestrels.

Falcons are found nearly all over the world. They live in many habitats, including forests, deserts, grasslands, and even cities.

Usually the female falcon is larger and bolder than the male. Falcons range in size from about 6 to 24 inches (15 to 61 centimeters). The gyrfalcon is the largest of the falcons.

The falcon has sharp claws and a short hooked beak. The beak usually has a small notch called a tooth. These features help it catch and kill prey animals.

A falconâ€™s shape helps it fly quickly. Its body is shaped like a bullet, while its wings are long and pointed. Unlike hawks and eagles, falcons rarely soar and glide. They dive down fast to catch prey. Some falcons capture other birds in midair. Other falcons kill hares, mice, lizards, and insects on the ground.
