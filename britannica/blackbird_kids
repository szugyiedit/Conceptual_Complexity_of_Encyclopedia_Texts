There are many species, or types, of blackbird—songbirds named for the black color of the males’ feathers. The Old World, or common, blackbird is related to thrushes, robins, and bluebirds. All other types of blackbird are in the same scientific family with grackles, cowbirds, orioles, and meadowlarks. The best-known types are the red-winged blackbird and the yellow-headed blackbird. Although crows and ravens also have black feathers, those birds are not called blackbirds.

The Old World blackbird lives in woods and gardens in Europe, Asia, New Zealand, and Australia. Most types of blackbird, however, are found in North America. They live in marshes, fields, prairies, woods, and towns.

Blackbirds generally range from about 8 to 11 inches (20 to 28 centimeters) in length. Among Old World blackbirds the males are black and the females are brown. This is true of many blackbirds. Often the males also have some brightly colored or dark, glossy feathers. The male red-winged blackbird has yellow and red feathers on its shoulders. The female is brown and streaky like a sparrow. The male yellow-headed blackbird has a bright yellow head and a black body. The female has a dull yellow head and a gray-brown body.

Most blackbirds eat mainly insects and grains and other seeds. They often look for food on the ground in large groups. The Old World blackbird eats insects, worms, and fruits.
