The rhea is a large, flightless bird related to the ostrich and emu. The birds are found in South America. The only two species that exist belong in the family Rheidae, order Rheiformes: the common rhea (Rhea americana) and Darwin’s rhea (Pterocnemia pennata).

The common rhea is found in open country from northeastern Brazil southward to Argentina, while Darwin’s rhea lives from Peru southward to Patagonia, at the southern tip of the continent. Both species are considerably smaller than the ostrich. The common rhea, for example, stands about 4 feet (120 centimeters) tall and weighs about 50 pounds (20 kilograms); Darwin’s rhea is somewhat smaller in size. The common rhea has brown or gray upper parts and whitish underparts, while Darwin’s rhea has brownish plumage tipped with white.

Rheas are distinguished from ostriches by their three-toed feet (those of the ostrich have two), their lack of fine plumes, and their brownish color. The birds prefer open, treeless country and run away when confronted by predators. They are omnivorous, eating a wide variety of plant and animal foods including seeds, roots and fruits, and insects.

Rheas do not form lasting pairs, and males incubate the eggs and raise the young. Moreover, the birds are polygamous—that is, the male broods the eggs of several females laid in one nest. The females lay up to 50 eggs in a shallow, grass-lined nest dug by a male. He then incubates the eggs, and the chicks hatch in about six weeks. The young are cared for by the male until they are about six weeks old. Rheas frequently associate with deer or guanacos (an animal of the camel family similar to a llama), forming mixed herds like those of ostriches, zebras, and antelopes.
