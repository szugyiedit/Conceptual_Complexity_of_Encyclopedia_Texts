 Cuckoos are members of the bird family Cuculidae. The family consists of more than 125 species, including the roadrunners and anis. More than a third of all cuckoo species are brood parasites; that is, they lay their eggs in the nests of other birds and the young cuckoos are reared by foster parents. Most cuckoos live in the tropics, but cuckoo species occur throughout the warmer and cool temperate parts of the world.

Only two North American species are occasionally brood-parasitic: the yellow-billed and the black-billed cuckoos. Both are slim, brownish birds with white breasts and long tails. The yellow-billed cuckoo may be distinguished from the black-billed by its reddish wings and yellow lower bill. The birds are found in forests, open woodland, and scrub. They nest throughout North America, from southern Canada through the southern United States and into Mexico, and winter in South America. Cuckoos feed on many destructive insects, particularly tent caterpillars.

The common, or European, cuckoo is bluish gray, with a long tail and pointed wings. Being a brood parasite, the female does not build a nest but deposits her eggs in the nests of other birds. The host bird then hatches the eggs and raises the young cuckoos.

The scientific name of the yellow-billed cuckoo is Coccyzus americanus; the black-billed cuckoo, C. erythropthalmus; and the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus.
