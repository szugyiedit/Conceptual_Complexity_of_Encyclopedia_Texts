The canary is a small bird known for its singing. Canaries are found wild in the Canary, Azores, and Madeira islands off the coast of northwestern Africa. Hundreds of years ago people caught these wild birds and began breeding them. Over time they have bred hundreds of different kinds of canaries that are sold as pets.

Several other small songbirds, such as the American goldfinch, are sometimes called wild canaries. But they are different types of birds. The canary is a species, or type, of songbird that is closely related to goldfinches, siskins, and redpolls. It is also related to other finches, cardinals, and sparrows.

In the wild, canaries measure about 5.5 inches (14 centimeters) in length. They are dull greenish brown with yellowish breasts. Pet canaries differ in size, form, feather color, and song. Breeders work to develop different characteristics in the different kinds of pet canaries. Many pet canaries have bright yellow feathers.

Canaries have short, cone-shaped bills. They use their bills to crack open seeds to get at the parts that are good to eat. They may also eat fruits.
