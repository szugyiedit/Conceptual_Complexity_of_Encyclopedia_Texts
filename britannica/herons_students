Many of the long-legged wading birds living in the marshes of saltwater lagoons, freshwater lakes, and rivers are herons. Included in the heron family, Ardeidae, are bitterns, boatbills, and egrets. The word egret usually refers to the beautiful white-plumed birds. They are famous for the long plumes, or aigrettes, that are worn by the males during the breeding season.

Herons and egrets are expert fishers. They stand like statues in the water until their keen eyes discover a fish swimming by. Then, at exactly the right instant, with one sudden jab of the bill, they seize their prey. Sometimes they stalk slowly through the shallow water, lifting each foot clear and setting it down again so gently that no ripple warns the fish or frog.

They live in nearly all parts of North and South America except the polar regions. They range in size from the small green heron to the great blue and the great white herons. A hundred or more birds often live in a single nesting site, or heronry. Their nests are crude platforms of sticks, usually placed in trees. The eggs number from three to six and are white or bluish green. Unlike cranes, with which they are often confused, herons and egrets fly with necks curved back so the head lies between the shoulders.

The great blue heron (Ardea herodias) ranges throughout the continental United States. It is 42 to 52 inches long. It is slaty blue on the back, wing coverts, and tail, with streaked gray under parts. A long black crest grows from the back of the head.

The green heron (Butorides virescens) is common in the eastern United States. A subspecies, Anthony’s green heron, lives on the Pacific coast. This bird is 16 to 22 inches long. It has a black crown, reddish-brown neck, green back and wings, and grayish under parts with dark streaks. Unlike most herons, it is a solitary bird. It has a curious trick of “freezing.” When it is startled it will fly to a perch and become absolutely rigid, with head and neck pointing skyward in line with the body. This posture, combined with the streaked breast and dark back, enables the bird to blend into the foliage and escape detection.

The great white heron (Ardea occidentalis), 48 to 54 inches long, has pure white plumage. It frequents southern Florida and the Florida Keys, where it nests in the mangrove swamps.

The black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) breeds throughout the United States mainland, excluding Alaska. It is two feet long. The crown and upper back are black, the lower back, wings, and tail ashy gray. Less common is the yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea), which has a more southerly range. The little blue heron (Florida caerulea) and the Louisiana heron (Hydranassa tricolor) are common in the Southern states from North Carolina to central Texas.

The most beautiful birds of the heron family are the egrets, represented in the United States by three species. The common egret (Casmerodius alba) is a white bird 37 to 42 inches long, not to be confused with the larger great white heron. It breeds from southeastern Oregon and Minnesota, Ohio, and New Jersey southward through Mexico and Central and South America. During the nesting season it wears a magnificent train of about 50 straight aigrette plumes that grow from between the shoulder blades and reach beyond the tail. Even more gorgeous is the nuptial dress of the snowy egret (Egretta thula), which breeds in northern California, Idaho, Colorado, Oklahoma, and New Jersey and along the Gulf coast through Central America, the West Indies, and South America. The rare reddish egret (Dichromanassa rufescens) breeds along the Gulf coast and in southern Florida.

To the egrets, beauty proved a curse, for their feathers were used to adorn hats and dresses. Once found by the tens of thousands, the birds were almost exterminated. Thanks to the Audubon societies, which obtained and enforced protective laws, they are again on the increase.
