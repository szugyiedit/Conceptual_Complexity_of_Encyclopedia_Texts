Loons are large waterbirds known for their unusual wailing calls. They are excellent swimmers and divers. In fact, these birds are called divers in Great Britain. Their feet are webbed, and their legs are set far back on their bodies. These features help loons swim but make the birds almost unable to walk.

There are several species, or types, of loon. Loons live near freshwater lakes and ponds in northern regions. They are found in the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Loons migrate, meaning that they fly to warmer areas for the winter.

Loons are about 2–3 feet (60–90 centimeters) long. They have stout bodies and pointed bills. Their wings are small and pointed. Their feathers are mainly black, brown, or gray on the upper body and white below.

Except for penguins, no birds are better divers than loons. Loons sometimes dive 200 feet (60 meters) below the surface of the water. They can stay underwater for three minutes or more. Loons put these skills to good use in catching fish and other small water animals to eat.

Loons make a wide variety of calls. They use some calls to frighten away invaders and others to locate or greet mates. Many people think the calls sound like eerie laughing, yodeling, wailing, or hooting.
