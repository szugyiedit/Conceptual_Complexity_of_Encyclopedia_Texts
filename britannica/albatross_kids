Albatrosses are large ocean birds with very long, narrow wings. They can fly long distances with little effort. They glide gracefully for hours, even in heavy storms. However, these birds make clumsy “crash” landings. They also attract mates with funny-looking dances and displays. For these reasons sailors sometimes call them gooney birds.

There are more than 10 species, or types, of albatross. They belong to the family of birds called Diomedeidae.

Albatrosses are birds of the open sea. They sleep on the surface of the water. They have no need to visit land except during breeding season. Most types fly over the South Pacific, Indian, and South Atlantic oceans. A few types fly over the North Pacific Ocean. Albatrosses breed and nest on islands.

Albatrosses are among the largest flying birds. They can weigh as much as 25 pounds (11 kilograms). The wingspan of the wandering albatross may be more than 11 feet (3 meters)—longer than that of any other living bird. An albatross has a big head, a hooked bill, and webbed toes. Most adult albatrosses have white body feathers with black, brown, or white wing feathers. A few types have brown feathers all over.

Albatrosses can soar on air currents for hours without flapping their wings. But they have difficulty flying in calm air.

Albatrosses eat mainly squid and sometimes fish. They also eat food scraps cast off by passing ships.
