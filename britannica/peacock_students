“As proud as a peacock,” this male bird struts as he displays his resplendent plumage. His feathers shine in metallic shades of bronze, blue, green, and gold, and a crest adorns his head. His chief glory is the 60-inch (150-centimeter) train of brilliantly marked plumes, each tipped with an iridescent “eye” ringed with blue and bronze. In the courtship display the peacock elevates his tail, which lies under the train, thus lifting the train, spreading it fanwise, and bringing it forward. As he struts he vibrates his tail rapidly, causing the quills of the train to rattle audibly. In this manner he hopes to attract females, known as peahens, which are less ornate.

Peafowl, as the peacock and peahen are called collectively, belong to the pheasant family. They live in the wild in Southeast Asia. The blue, or Indian, peacock is found in India and Sri Lanka; the green, or Javanese, peacock is found from Myanmar to Java. Hens of both species are green and brown and almost as big as the males, but they lack the train and crest.

In the wild, both species of peacock live in open lowland forests. They flock by day and, when going to roost in tall trees, they bugle or call loudly. The male bird forms a breeding group of one to five hens, and each hen lays four to eight whitish eggs in a depression in the ground.

Domesticated peacocks, now common in almost every country, date from ancient times. To the ancient Greeks the peacock was known as Hera’s bird. According to a well-known myth, the strange eyelike markings of the plumes were the hundred eyes of the giant Argus, set on the peacock’s feathers by Hera.

The scientific name of the blue peacock is Pavo cristatus, and of the green peacock, P. muticus. The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) was discovered in 1936. It is the only large member of the pheasant family in Africa. The cock is mainly blue and green, with a short rounded tail; the hen is reddish and green, with a brown topknot.
