Crows are large birds with shiny black feathers. They often live together in large families. They are known for their loud voices and their intelligence. These clever, curious birds have a reputation as thieves and pranksters. They have been known to fly off with all sorts of little shiny objects, including people’s car keys. Pet crows have even learned to mimic, or imitate, human speech.

Crows belong to the group of birds called songbirds. However, their calls are typically harsh sounding, as in the “caw” of the American crow. There are more than 20 species, or types, of crow. They look much like ravens, their close relatives. They are also related to jays and magpies.

Various types of crow are found nearly all around the world. They live in many different habitats, including woodlands, farms, and cities. The American crow is common in the United States and Canada. The carrion crow is found in Europe and much of Asia. Other well-known types include the fish crow, the pied crow, and the house crow.

Crows tend to be smaller than ravens. Large crows may reach about 20 inches (50 centimeters) long. They are all or mostly black. Crows have powerful beaks, which they use for catching small animals and opening seeds.

Crows eat a great variety of plants and small animals. Since they eat corn and other grains, they can be a nuisance to farmers. However, they also help farmers by eating insect pests.
