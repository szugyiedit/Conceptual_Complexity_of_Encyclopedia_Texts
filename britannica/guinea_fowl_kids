Guinea fowl are African birds that live in the wild and on farms. Wild guinea fowl are popular targets for hunting. Domesticated, or tame, guinea fowl are raised for their meat. Some farmers keep guinea fowl for guarding property because their calls are quite noisy.

Several species, or types, of guinea fowl are widespread across Africa. Guinea fowl also live in Madagascar and on other islands in the Indian Ocean. The largest and most colorful species is the vulturine guinea fowl of eastern Africa. The helmet guinea fowl is a common species in the wild and on farms. This species is also raised outside Africa—for example, in the Americas and Europe.

Guinea fowl are about the same size as chickens. However, a guinea fowl has a stouter, more bulbous body. It also has short, rounded wings. A guinea fowl typically has blue-gray feathers dotted with white spots. The helmet guinea fowl has a bluish red, featherless head topped with a “helmet.” This helmet is actually a hornlike crest. Red and blue wattles hang from the face.

Guinea fowl live in flocks. They scratch on the ground in search of insects, seeds, and bulbs. At night they sleep in trees. When guinea fowl are alarmed, they run. If necessary, they will fly short distances. Helmet guinea fowl make loud, repetitive calls.

Females nest in hollows on the ground. They lay about 12 spotted eggs at a time. The eggs hatch within one month. The babies follow their parents right after hatching.

There is a Swahili folktale that explains how the guinea fowl got its spots.
