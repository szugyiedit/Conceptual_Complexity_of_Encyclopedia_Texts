Geese are large birds with loud, honking calls. Along with ducks and swans, they belong to a group of birds called waterfowl in North America and wildfowl in Europe. These birds are equally at home on the water, on the land, or in the air. Common species, or types, of goose include the Canada goose, the greylag, the barnacle goose, and the snow goose.

People have kept and bred geese for at least 4,000 years. People eat goose meat and use goose feathers to stuff pillows and quilts. In addition, hunters shoot wild geese for sport.

Geese live near water, mostly in the northern half of the world. Many geese migrate, or fly long distances between their summer and winter homes. They nest in cold northern regions during the summer and fly south for the winter. However, some Canada geese live in the same parts of the United States or Canada year-round.

Geese are generally larger than ducks but smaller than swans. For instance, the Canada goose is about 36 inches (91 centimeters) long. But geese have many features in common with ducks and swans. They have webbed feet, which help them paddle through water. They also have a gland near the tail that makes oil. This oil helps protect the feathers from water. An inner layer of soft feathers called down helps keep waterfowl warm.

Most geese are black, brown, gray, or white. They have heavier bodies and longer necks than ducks do. Geese are also better at walking than other waterfowl are. This is because their legs are farther forward on their bodies.

Geese have humped bills that become narrower toward the tip. Their bills are good for grasping grasses, which is their main food.
