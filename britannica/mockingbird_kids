Mockingbirds are songbirds known for imitating the songs of other birds. The common, or northern, mockingbird may learn the songs of more than 30 other kinds of birds. It may also imitate such sounds as the cackling of a hen or the barking of a dog. Mockingbirds sing their own musical songs, too.

Mockingbirds live in bushy areas and suburbs in the Americas. The common mockingbird is found in the United States and Mexico. The blue mockingbird lives in Mexico. Several other species, or types, of mockingbird live in Central and South America.

Mockingbirds are medium-sized birds with slim bodies and long tails. They are mostly gray or brownish. Common mockingbirds are about 10.5 inches (27 centimeters) long. Their bodies are ashy gray on top and paler gray below. Their wings and tails are marked with white.

The bill of a mockingbird is strong and slender, with a slight downward curve. Mockingbirds use their bills to eat insects, seeds, and berries.

Mockingbirds strongly defend their territory. In fact, many types will attack dogs, cats, or even humans whom they see as a threat.
