The birds called woodpeckers are known for pecking holes in tree bark to find insects to eat. Most woodpeckers live in forests, spending their lives mainly in trees.

There are about 180 species, or types, of woodpecker. They include the birds called flickers and sapsuckers. Woodpeckers look like songbirds in many ways. But scientists classify woodpeckers in a different grouping, the order Piciformes. They are related to toucans.

Woodpeckers live nearly all over the world. The greatest numbers of them are found in South America and Southeast Asia.

Woodpeckers vary in length from about 6 to 18 inches (15 to 46 centimeters). They are often black and white with patches of red or yellow on the head.

Most woodpeckers fly with short swoops. Each of their feet has two toes pointing forward and two toes pointing backward. This helps the birds cling to tree trunks. The strong, rigid tail feathers help the bird hold itself against the tree. The long, sticky tongue helps the bird trap insects.

Most types of woodpecker eat insects found in tree bark. The bird often uses its bill to tap holes into the bark. This normally does not hurt the trees. In fact, woodpeckers eat insects that are harmful to trees. Some kinds also eat fruit. Sapsuckers also feed on sap, a liquid made by trees. Flickers eat mainly ants on the ground.
