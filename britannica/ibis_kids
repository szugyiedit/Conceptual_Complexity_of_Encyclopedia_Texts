Ibises are birds with long, slender bills that curve downward. They are wading birds, meaning that they typically walk through shallow water when feeding. They usually feed, fly, and breed in huge groups. The ancient Egyptians believed that one particular type of ibis was holy. After these birds died, the Egyptians carefully preserved them as mummies.

There are about 20 species, or types, of ibis. They belong to a scientific family that also includes spoonbills. As its name suggests, a spoonbill has a beak with a rounded tip that looks like a spoon. These birds are also related to herons, storks, and flamingos.

Ibises are found in most of the worldâ€™s warm and hot regions. They tend to live near shallow bodies of water, including marshes, lagoons, lakes, and bays.

Ibises are usually about 22 to 30 inches (55 to 75 centimeters) long. They have long legs, necks, and bills. Their tails are short. Most ibises have white, black, or brown feathers. However, the scarlet ibis is bright red. The hadada ibis has greenish feathers, and the glossy ibis has dark brown and shiny purple feathers. In many ibises part of the face lacks feathers but has brightly colored skin.

An ibis uses its long bill to search the mud for food. Ibises eat such animals as shellfish, insects, worms, and small fish.
