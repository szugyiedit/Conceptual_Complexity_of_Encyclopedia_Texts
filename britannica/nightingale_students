 Few birds are as celebrated in literature as the nightingale, but residents of the Americas must go abroad to hear this famous bird, for it does not live in the New World. Its relatives, the thrushes, are the only birds in the Americas that approach the nightingale in beauty of song. The nightingale is found throughout Europe, most abundantly in southern France, Spain, and Portugal, and in parts of England.

During the mating and nesting season, from mid-April to mid-June, the male sings day and night. His song is a variegated, melodious outpouring with frequent crescendos and is used to delimit his territory, which is sometimes quite small. His brilliant song contrasts sharply with his drab plumage. The bird is about 6 1/2 inches (17 centimeters) long, with rusty brown and gray feathers. It is shy and stays close to the ground, where it feeds on insects and larvae.

The nest is a loosely built cup of dry leaves that the female builds in the center of the territory. She lays from four to six eggs, of a deep olive color, and incubates them for only about 13 days.

In order to ensure a steady diet, the nightingale migrates to winter in Africa. It travels at night and may begin its journey as early as September.

The nightingale belongs to the family Muscicapidae and to the subfamily of thrushes, or Turdinae. The common European nightingale is Erithacus (or Luscinia) megarhynchos.
