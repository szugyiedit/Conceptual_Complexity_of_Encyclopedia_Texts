 Many kinds of wild guinea fowl are found in Africa. The birds derive their name from a section of the west coast of Africa. They have been domesticated since the days of ancient Greece. The common domestic guinea fowl of North America (Numida meleagris), introduced by the early settlers, is descended from one of the wild African species. There are three varieties—pearl, white, and lavender.

Domestic birds cling to their wild habits and are hard to raise for this reason. They hide their nests, and the hen may refuse to incubate the eggs if the nest is disturbed. They prefer to roost in trees and are difficult to confine in a poultry yard. They destroy many insects about the farmyard, however, and are useful in protecting other poultry. They are fighters, and the loud, one-syllable shriek of the male gives warning of intruders. The female has a call that sounds like “buck-wheat, buck-wheat.” The dark, gamy flesh of the guinea fowl is considered a delicacy. The birds weigh up to 3 1/2 pounds (1.5 kilograms) at maturity.

Wild guinea fowl are of three kinds—those with a crest of feathers on the head, those with a bony helmet and a bare head, and those with a patch of feathers on the back of the head. The domestic form is derived from the helmeted kind. Some of this kind also live on Madagascar.
