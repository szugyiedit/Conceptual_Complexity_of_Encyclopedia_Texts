 The cardinal, or redbird, is a North American songbird found mostly east of the Rocky Mountains and belonging to the family Fringillidae. Its scientific name is Cardinalis cardinalis. The cardinal is about 8 inches (20 centimeters) long, a little smaller than a robin. It has a high crest of feathers on its head. The throat and area around the base of the bill are black. The male is bright red. The female and young have gray-brown backs and dull red wings, tail, and crest. Pairs of the birds utter loud, clear whistling notes year-round in gardens and open woodlands.

Cardinals build their nests in low bushes. The nests are made of twigs, roots, and strips of bark and lined with grass. Cardinal eggs are bluish white spotted with brown. They hatch in 12 days. Cardinals eat weed seeds, berries, and a great variety of insects and larvae. They do not migrate but spend the winter in their nesting areas. The cardinal is especially abundant in the southeastern United States and has been introduced into Hawaii, southern California, and Bermuda. It is the state bird of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.
