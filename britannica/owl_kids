Owls are birds of prey, meaning that they hunt and eat animals. Unlike most other birds of prey, owls are nocturnal, or active at night. Their nighttime activity, quiet flight, and strange calls have made them the subject of many stories. Common types of owl include barn owls and the short-eared owl.

Owls live around the world in almost every kind of habitat. Their length varies from about 5 to 28 inches (13 to 70 centimeters). Most owls have brown, gray, or white feathers with streaks or spots.

All owls look about the same. Each owl has a large head, a flat face, a hooked beak, and large eyes. It also has a short tail, long wings, and sharp claws. Owls have excellent eyesight and hearing. An owl cannot move its eyes much. But it can turn its head far around to look directly backward.

Most owls eat small animals such as mice, voles, and rabbits. Some owls eat insects, birds, or other animals. Most owls swallow their prey whole. They later spit up the bones, fur, and feathers that they cannot digest.

Owls make a variety of sounds. An owl may snap its bill, clap its wings in flight, or sing. Its song may be anything from deep hoots to chirps or whistles.
