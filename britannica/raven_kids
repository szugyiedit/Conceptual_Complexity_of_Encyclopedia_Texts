Ravens are large, black birds that are closely related to crows. They belong to a scientific group of birds called songbirds. However, their voices do not sound very musical. They make a variety of noises, such as caws, croaks, and gurgles. People in some cultures think of these dark birds as symbols of death and bad things to come. However, some people admire ravens for the birds’ great intelligence.

Ravens and crows are in the same family as jays and magpies. There are several different species, or types, of raven. The common raven is found in parts of North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Other types of raven also live in those four continents as well as in Australia.

Ravens are very hardy birds. They are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, mountains, deserts, and frozen plains.

Ravens look a good deal like crows. However, ravens are heavier and have bigger bills. They can measure up to 26 inches (66 centimeters) in length. Ravens also have shaggier feathers than crows do, especially around the throat. Ravens’ feathers are all or mostly black, often with a blue or purplish shimmer. Several types have some white or brown markings. The common raven is all black.

Ravens eat a varied diet that includes mice, insects, grain, and the eggs of other birds. They also feed on dead animals and garbage.
