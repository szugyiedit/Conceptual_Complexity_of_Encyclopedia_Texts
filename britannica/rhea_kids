Rheas are large birds that are similar to ostriches and emus. Like those birds, rheas cannot fly.

There are two species, or types, of rhea, and they both live in South America. The common rhea is found from northeastern Brazil southward to Argentina. The bird known as Darwin’s rhea lives from Peru southward to Patagonia, at the tip of the continent. All rheas live in open areas with some trees or other plants.

Rheas are considerably smaller than ostriches. The common rhea stands about 4 feet (120 centimeters) tall and weighs about 50 pounds (20 kilograms). The common rhea has brown or gray upperparts and whitish underparts. Darwin’s rhea is somewhat smaller in size, and its brownish plumage is tipped with white. The birds have large wings, but they use them only for balance and for steering while they are running.

Rheas eat both plants and animals, including seeds, roots and fruits, and insects. They often live in groups with deer or guanacos.

Male rheas mate with several females. Those females all lay several eggs over a period of a week to 10 days in a large pit that the male digs. The male then incubates the eggs, or sits on them to protect and keep them warm, until they hatch up to 40 days later. The male continues to watch over the new chicks for several weeks after they hatch.
