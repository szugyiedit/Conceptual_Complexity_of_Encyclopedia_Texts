Hawks are birds of prey, meaning that they hunt and kill animals for food. Hawks are closely related to eagles, kites, harriers, buzzards, and some vultures. Those birds are sometimes also called hawks because they are in the hawk family. There are about 50 kinds of “true” hawks. These include the sparrowhawks and the goshawks.

Two typical hawks are the sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper’s hawk. These hawks have a gray back and a rusty brown underside. The sharp-shinned hawk is about 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. The Cooper’s hawk is larger, with a length of about 14 to 20 inches (36 to 51 centimeters).

Hawks live in forests in most parts of the world. They usually have a long tail and short, rounded wings. These features allow them to fly fast and low in areas with bushes and trees. A hawk often catches its prey by swiftly following the animal as it tries to escape. It uses its sharp claws and beak to catch and kill the animal.

Many people think hawks are harmful because some kinds eat songbirds and poultry. But most hawks are actually more useful to humans overall. They eat rodents, insects, and other pests. Hawks also eat other small animals such as squirrels and lizards.
