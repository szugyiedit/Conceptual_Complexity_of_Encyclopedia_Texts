The Portuguese call it beija-flôr, meaning “kiss-flower.” The Aztecs adorned Montezuma’s ceremonial cloaks with its feathers. The dazzling hummingbird still captures people’s fancy.

Because of special flight muscles that control wing beats of 38 to 78 times per second, a hummingbird can hover in the air and is the only bird that can fly backward. The smallest hummingbirds can attain wing-beat frequencies of 200 per second during courtship flights when the males show off their brilliant plumage. The female builds a cup-shaped nest from moss, seed down, and spider webs. She alone incubates the tiny eggs, of which there are usually only two, and rears the young.

Hummingbirds drink nectar at the rate of about 13 licks per second. They also eat insects. The specialized tongue bones of the hyoid apparatus allow the tongue, which is divided into two equal lobes at its front half, to extend beyond the tip of the long narrow bill. This enables the hummingbird to reach nectar deep within the flower.

Most of the 338 species in the hummingbird family, Trochilidae, live along the equator across the countries of South America, but they range from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. The giant hummingbird, 8 inches (20 centimeters) long, lives at altitudes of 15,000 feet (4,600 meters) in the Andes Mountains. The Cuban bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world, measuring 2 1/4 inches (6 centimeters). (See also birds.)
