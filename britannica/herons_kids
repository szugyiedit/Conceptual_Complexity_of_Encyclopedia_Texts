Herons are long-legged birds typically found in ponds, marshes, and swamps. They also live along coasts and freshwater lakes and streams. Herons are wading birds, which means they feed while standing or walking in shallow water. They are found nearly all over the world, especially in warm regions.

There are about 60 species, or types, of heron. Several types of heron are called egrets. Herons are in the same family as bitterns. They are also related to storks, ibises, and flamingos.

A heron is typically a tall bird with broad wings and a long neck. Unlike most other birds, a heron flies with its head held back against its body. Its bill is long, straight, and pointed. Herons often have gray, brown, black, or white feathers. Most egrets are white.

The largest heron is the goliath heron, which is about 59 inches (150 centimeters) long. The great blue heron is slightly smaller. On the other hand, the green heron is only about 20 inches (51 centimeters) long.

Most herons feed during the day. However, the types called night herons are active mainly at night. Most kinds of heron stand still like a statue in the water while looking for food. When they spot a fish, frog, or other small water animal, they jab their spearlike bills into the prey.
