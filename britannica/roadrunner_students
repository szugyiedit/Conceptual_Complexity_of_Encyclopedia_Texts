A familiar and amusing bird, the roadrunner lives in the deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico. It flies very little: it was named for its habit of dashing along desert roads in search of cover or in pursuit of lizards, insects, or snakes. Its speed has been timed at greater than 15 miles (24 kilometers) per hour. The roadrunner presents a comical appearance as it sprints along with neck and head outstretched, shaggy crest raised, short wings outspread, and long tail jerking up and down.

It is a large bird about 22 inches (56 centimeters) long. The coarse feathers are streaked olive-brown and tipped with white, changing to bronzy green at the tail. A small bare patch of skin behind the eyes is blue and red. Its stout legs are bluish.

Roadrunners belong to the cuckoo family, Cuculidae. The greater roadrunner, Geococcyx californianus, is the state bird of New Mexico. The lesser roadrunner is G. velox. (See also Birds.)
