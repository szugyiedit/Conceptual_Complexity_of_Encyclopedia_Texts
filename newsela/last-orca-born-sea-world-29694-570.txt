Very last orca bred in confinement MIAMI, Florida — An orca whale was just born in SeaWorld. It is the last whale that will be born at the park.  Many people are now against keeping orcas in places like SeaWorld. They think the whales should be in the wild. There have been protests against the park. Fewer people visit each year.  SeaWorld said the orca was born last week on Wednesday. They have not named it yet. They are not sure if it is a boy or a girl. Both mother and baby are healthy.  The mother is 25-year-old Takara. She was already expecting to have the baby whale when SeaWorld said it would stop breeding orcas last year. Chris Dold is in charge of the animals at SeaWorld. He said everyone at the park is happy. He was coming back from Abu Dhabi. It is a city located in the United Arab Emirates found in the Middle East. SeaWorld's first park without orcas is being built there.  SeaWorld will no longer have whale shows by 2019\. "Blackfish" is a movie based on facts that came out in 2013\. The movie made it seem like living in SeaWorld is bad for the whales. They have less space to swim. They are often separated from each other.  The newborn calf's father is Kyuquot. He lives in the San Antonio park in Texas. In the U.S. SeaWorld has 23 orcas. People will still be able to see the orcas. Scientists will be able to continue studying them.  SeaWorld will not make the whales perform tricks. Instead, they will show the orcas in pools that seem more like the ocean. They will try to teach people about the whales. SeaWorld has not taken in a wild orca in 40 years. Most of its orcas were born in their parks. Some scientists are unhappy that SeaWorld will stop breeding orcas. They will have fewer orcas to study. For example, Heather Hill is a scientist who will study how the whales sleep. She thinks scientists will lose the chance to learn about the animals.  Tracy Reiman helps run People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. It fights for the rights of animals. She said the mother and her baby should be sent to a safe place in the ocean.  This is Takara's fifth baby whale. SeaWorld does not plan to move her or any more of its orcas.  Dold said in March that SeaWorld will continue studying orcas. It will keep trying to save them.
