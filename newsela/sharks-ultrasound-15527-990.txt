Study uses ultrasound on sharks MIAMI, Fla. — For years, warm shallow waters in a corner of the Bahamas have drawn an astonishing number of large tiger sharks. Scientists studying how sharks move around during the year were mystified by this pattern. Now a team of scientists, including University of Miami shark expert Neil Hammerschlag, may have their answer. The group released a new study in which it relied on ultrasound. It is the same technology used to see if animals are going to have a baby. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/sharkultrasound.png) Hammerschlag first began diving at the site known as Tiger Beach in 2003\. He noticed something surprising: Nearly all the sharks were female. The constant buffet from dive tour operators tossing food in the waters could be the reason for the numbers, he said. That didn’t explain the absence of males, though. So maybe, he reasoned, it had something to do with reproduction. While sharks draw a lot of attention, little is actually known about how they live and love. Only one species, nurse sharks, has been documented migrating to the Dry Tortugas in early summer to mate, according to the team’s study, published last week in Aquatic Biology. Lemon sharks will travel to Bimini to give birth. Blacktip reef sharks travel to French Polynesia. Part of the problem comes from documenting reproduction, or how sharks make babies. Until now, reproduction studies usually required killing and cutting open sharks, something researchers don’t relish. So Hammerschlag and co-author James Sulikowsky of the University of New England got to thinking about the way humans confirm pregnancies. “When you want to tell if they’re pregnant, you don’t have to kill them, thank goodness,” he said. The scientists wanted to use something like the methods for figuring out if a woman is pregnant. Just at sea. With a man-eating 14-foot shark that can weigh as much as 1,400 pounds. Portable, waterproof sonograms developed for animal breeding made the job easier. Sonograms use sound waves to make images. The portable sonograms are lightweight, easy to maneuver and come with goggles, rather than a screen, to view images. What remained difficult was getting the sharks to keep still. Scientists did not want the sharks to take a bite out of the doctor, though being cranky would be understandable given a shark’s 16-month pregnancy period. This is where being an expert shark hunter comes in handy. First the team baited lines attached to a secure floating drum, which they checked every hour. Once the team hooked a shark, they would reel it in. They used their 66-foot research boat to help in the tug-of-war, since the sharks are big enough to pull a shark fisher overboard. Once the shark was close enough to the boat, a team member would lasso the shark’s tail and pull it out of the water, essentially disabling the shark’s propeller. Other members then wrestled it aboard a submerged platform and inserted a 3-inch pipe into its mouth to pump oxygenated saltwater over the shark’s gills. In addition to the sonogram, researchers also drew blood to measure hormone levels. Total exam time: about 20 minutes. While this plan may not sound exactly foolproof, researchers had a few things going for them, Hammerschlag said. First, sharks bite when they’re stressed. The pipe acted like a pacifier. Second, the pumped water had a high oxygen content, which also soothed the sharks. “Every now and then (a shark) kind of tenses up and wriggles around, and you let it do what it wants,” he said. Of the 65 sharks caught between 2011 and 2014, 59 were females. Of those, some were pregnant. Juvenile females were also present, but there were no baby sharks. The area’s shallow sandy bottom provides little for the sharks to eat, but the water is warm and mostly calm. The warm water might also assist in growing the baby inside the mother. The same has been seen in nurse sharks, the team reported. Because the area lies within the protected Bahamas Exclusive Economic Zone, the team also believes the findings might show the value of conservation efforts for tiger sharks. These sharks are considered threatened globally but have begun to rebound in the Atlantic Ocean. Hammerschlag said a lot of shark populations are declining in the Atlantic. Now, he said, "It seems tiger sharks are on a recovery trend, and it may be in large part because of the Tiger Beach area.” Asked if anything surprised him during the three-year study, Hammerschlag said, “It amazed me that sometimes the big females are not pregnant. I’d think they were pregnant when in fact they just ate a sea turtle.”
