Marcie raises her own bees in her backyard. Marcie Davis read a story in the newspaper. It said that bees are dying too fast. Marcie wanted to help. Marcie decided to start raising her own bees. She has a big yard. She lives in Florida. The weather is warm and there are lots of plants. Marcie thought it would be a great place for bees. Marcie built 12 hives. Then she got some bad news. She found out her beehives were against the law. Marcie was very surprised. Marcie was also confused. The story she read said Florida needs more bees. Many bees have gotten sick. Some have died in bad weather. Other bees have been killed by accident. Farmers put poison on their crops. They don't want bugs to eat the crops. The poison kills the bugs. But it kills the bees, too. Farmers do not want to hurt the bees. They know bees are good for their crops. Bees fly from plant to plant. They carry pollen to each one. That helps make more plants grow. Many people are worried about the bees. That is why Florida made a new law. The law allows backyard beehives. States like Florida are split up into smaller parts. Those parts are called counties. Marcie's county has its own laws. One law of the county says that people cannot have beehives in their yards. Marcie had to go to court to fight for her beehives. She had to ask the judge to let her keep them. She needed help. That is when she found Ross Toyne. Ross is a lawyer. He knows a lot about the laws. He also knows a lot about bees. His twin daughters raise bees in their backyard. They are only 10 years old. Ross helped Marcie explain her story to the judge. The county's lawyers explained their story, too. The whole thing took about one year. Then the county stopped fighting. Ross and Marcie were surprised that the county gave up. They had saved Marcie's beehives. They also helped other people in Marcie's county. Now everyone can help the bees.
