Bees are smart despite tiny brains Bees have very small brains. They are still very smart. Scientists found out that bees can learn something new to get something they want. Then, they can then teach other bees to do the same thing. Olli Loukola is a scientist who studies how insects behave. He did an experiment with bees. He said that the bees did not just copy what they saw. They got better at it. “This is of course amazing for small-brained insects," he said. Even people cannot always get better at something just by copying. The scientists showed the bees how to move a ball. The ball had to go from one spot to a different spot. When the bees did it right, they got rewarded with sugar. ## Bees Teach Other Bees What They Have Learned The bees liked the reward. They got better and better at moving the balls. Then, they got more of the reward.  The scientists tried something else. They put the bees who knew how get the reward with other bees who did not. The new bees watched the old bees move the ball. The old bees got the reward. The new bees learned from the other bees. They even learned how to do it faster. ## Small Brains, But Very Smart All brains have neurons. The neurons let you think. Many scientists are excited about what they learned about the bees. Even though bees do not have a lot of neurons, they are still very smart. Bees can talk to each other, but not like we do. They use their bodies instead of words. They butt heads, bump into each other and they even dance. Scientists used to think that an animal with a small brain could not be very smart. But this experiment shows that is not true.
