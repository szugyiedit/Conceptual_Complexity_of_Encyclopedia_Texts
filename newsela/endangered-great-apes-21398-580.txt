World Conservation Congress in Hawaii reveals changes to endangered species list. HONOLULU, Hawaii — The eastern gorilla is in trouble. It has been listed as critically endangered. It is in danger of going extinct. An animal species is extinct when there are no more of its kind living in the world. There are only 5,000 eastern gorillas left in the wild. There used to be close to 17,000 eastern gorillas. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature is a group that fights to protect wildlife. The group is also called the IUCN. The group has released its Red List of Endangered Species. The list contains more than 80,000 kinds of animals. Almost 24,000 kinds of animals are in danger of going extinct. Inger Andersen is in charge of the IUCN. She is sad about what is happening to the gorillas. Andersen said it is up to all of us to "protect the future of our planet." Eastern gorillas are dying because of hunting. Most eastern gorillas live in Africa. They live in a country called the Congo. Protecting the animals there can be hard. The country's government is shaky, said Russell Mittermeier. He is a scientist. He studies gorillas with the IUCN. Mittermeier said there are no easy fixes to the problem.  Andrew Plumptre is a scientist. He is glad the IUCN put the eastern gorilla on the critically endangered list. It will help people see what is happening to these animals. The IUCN holds a big meeting every year. More than 9,000 leaders come from around the world. They meet to talk about saving animals. The meeting is happening this week in Hawaii. Other animals on the Red List are doing OK. The giant panda used to be on the endangered list. Then humans began to protect the animals' home. The giant panda is not endangered anymore. Plants and animals all over the world need better protection. In Hawaii, most of the native plants face extinction. In Africa, many plains zebras are dying.
