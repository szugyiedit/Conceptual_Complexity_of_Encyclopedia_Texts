Researchers say more efforts are needed to protect Borneo's shrinking orangutan population. ![Image 2\.

The steepest percentage losses occurred in regions where the forest has been cut down to make way for palm oil and acacia plantations. Palm oil is an extremely versatile resource, found in everything from snack foods to lip gloss. Demand for palm oil has been causing major deforestation in tropical regions. Sap from acacia trees has many uses as well, including paints, candies and even fireworks.  While many orangutans died in places producing palm oil and acacia, more animals were killed by hunters who ventured into the forest. Others were killed by farm workers when the apes came onto on agricultural land, a study found. Researchers estimate that the number of orangutans left on Borneo now stands at between 70,000 and 100,000, meaning the population more than halved over the study period, which ran from 1999 to 2015\. Without new efforts to protect the animals, the numbers could fall at least another 45,000 in the next 35 years, the conservationists predict. The real decline could be worse, because the prediction is based only on habitat loss, and does not include known killings. The bleak assessment of the state of the Bornean apes comes from an international team of conservationists. They compiled one of the most far-reaching reports yet on the animals, which in 2016 were declared “critically endangered.” This designation is made by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “I expected to see a fairly steep decline, but I did not anticipate it would be this large,” said Serge Wich, a co-author of the report at Liverpool John Moores University. “When we did the analyses, we ran them again and again to figure out if we had made a mistake somewhere. You think the numbers can’t be that high, but unfortunately, they are.” The researchers studied 16 years of ground and helicopter surveys that recorded the numbers and locations of nests that orangutans built in the trees from branches and leaves. The nests have been used to estimate the sizes of orangutan populations because the animals themselves are so elusive. Writing in the journal Current Biology, the team described how the decline in nests from 1999 to 2015 points to the stunning loss of 148,500 orangutans in Borneo. The conservationists identified 64 separate groups of orangutans on the island. However, only 38 are thought to make up more than 100 individuals, the minimum that is considered practical for a group. <img class="centered" alt="Image 3.

In the dense forests, orangutan numbers fell 50 percent. While that is a lower rate, it amounts to more animals because most of the apes live in these areas. “This is the biggest chunk of the loss,” said Maria Voigt at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. “More than 70 percent of the orangutans lost are in the forest.” Hunters in Borneo tend to enter the forest to find pigs and deer, but if they encounter a large orangutan, they can take the animals for food. Female orangutans are occasionally killed for their young, which are then sold as pets. Far more of the apes die when they venture on to plantations, and into people’s gardens, where they are shot or killed with machetes. Last week, authorities on Borneo found the body of a male orangutan. It had machete scars and wounds from 130 airgun pellets. “We need to work with people to help them understand that orangutans are not dangerous and that it’s illegal to kill them,” Wich said. One approach that might work, he said, is to have Indonesian and Malaysian celebrities raise awareness of orangutans through social media. “We know this decline has been largely due to hunting, and if we can turn that around, these orangutans could, over a long period, bounce back. When you lost the habitat, it’s gone forever, but the forests are still there. If we can stop the hunting and killing, we can reverse the trend.” “Orangutans are disappearing at an alarming rate," said Emma Keller at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a nonprofit group. Their forest habitats have been lost and hurt, she said, "and hunting threatens the existence of this magnificent great ape." She added, "Immediate action is needed to reform industries that have pushed orangutans to the brink of extinction. Consumers can make a difference through only supporting brands and retailers that buy sustainable palm oil."
