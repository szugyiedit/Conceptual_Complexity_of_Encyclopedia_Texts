Spiders have big appetites No matter where you go, you are probably near a spider. They live everywhere in the world. Scientists studied some North Carolina homes. They found spiders in every house. Some scientists say on average there are 131 spiders for every square yard of land.  Scientists knew another thing about spiders. They have big appetites for food. Two scientists wondered just how much food that was. The scientists' names were Martin Nyffeler and Klaus Birkhofer. The two scientists studied how much spiders eat. What they found is shocking.  Most spiders just eat insects. Some larger spiders eat bigger creatures. They might snack on lizards. They could eat birds. They might eat small furry animals. Spiders eat between 400 million and 800 million tons of creatures in a year. That is as much meat as all 7 billion humans eat. Humans eat about 400 million tons of meat. Spiders eat a lot. They eat about one-tenth of their body weight in food every day. Imagine you weigh 100 pounds. This would mean you eat 10 pounds of food each day. There are even more strange facts in this story. The weight of all the spider food is very heavy. It weighs more than all the humans in the world put together. In other words, spiders could eat all of us. They would still be hungry. The scientists wanted to know more. They wanted to know whether spiders are more likely to live in certain types of areas. They found some interesting facts. Some places have fewer spiders. Hot sandy deserts have fewer spiders. There are also fewer spiders in freezing tundra areas in the mountains. Most other places are fine for spiders, though. Some hold 1,000 or more spiders per square yard of land. The writers say these places have "favorable" conditions for spiders to live in. They don't say what "favorable" means, though. Spiders eating so much is not so bad. It actually helps humans. Spiders mostly eat bugs. This means there are fewer flies and mosquitoes to bother us.
