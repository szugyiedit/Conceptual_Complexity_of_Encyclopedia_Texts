The park will double the size of the pool. Visitors will be able to see the killer whales from above and below. The movie "Blackfish" said the orcas were not being treated well. SAN DIEGO, Calif. — SeaWorld San Diego is a popular place to view sea creatures up close. Lately, though, some people became upset with SeaWorld. They say the company mistreats orcas. Orcas are giant sea animals better known as killer whales. SeaWorld San Diego has 10 orcas. A movie called "Blackfish" said SeaWorld's killer whales were not treated well. On Friday, SeaWorld San Diego announced several changes. They will make the orcas' lives better, it said. A bigger orca pool will be built. The new pool is called the Blue World Project. It will be 50 feet deep and 350 feet long. It doubles the size of the current one. Visitors will be able to see the orcas underwater. SeaWorld says it will be the first orca pool like it in the world. Company officials say the pool will be completed by 2018. Other SeaWorld parks, in Florida and Texas, will build their own new pools. SeaWorld's president, Jim Atchison, says the new pool will be unusual. It will change "how visitors experience killer whales," he said. Atchison said visitors will be able to choose their view. They can "walk alongside the whales as if they were at the shore." Or, they can watch the whales swim underwater or see them from above. Some of the views will be very up close. SeaWorld will also spend $10 million to study orcas in the wild. Finally, it will put together a team of scientists. The team will watch over SeaWorld's orca program. The scientists will try to improve the “health and well-being” of SeaWorld’s orcas. The new plans did not satisfy People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). PETA is an animal rights group. It wants the orcas to be put in large ocean shelters. “A bigger prison is still a prison,” said PETA lawyer Jared Goodman. SeaWorld made its announcement during a bad time for the company. Since the release of the documentary, many people have grown angry at SeaWorld. The movie attacks the company’s treatment of orcas. SeaWorld San Diego gets 4.4 million visitors a year. The orca show is its most popular event. Now, people are starting to stay away. The company admits that ticket sales have dropped. Attendance has been hurt by claims the orcas are being mistreated. San Diego's leaders still support SeaWorld. The company gives jobs to many people in the city. The San Diego City Council voted to make March "SeaWorld Month." City Council President Todd Gloria praised the new pool. He said it will make things better for the whales and for visitors to the park.
