There is not a huge demand for pet skunks, but some people want one. So a small pet store sells them, along with dragons, rats and other unusual creatures that big stores don't bother with. LODI, N.J. â€” Joe Averso owns a different kind of pet store. His shop is in Lodi, New Jersey. It sells uncommon pets. Not everyone wants cats or dogs. So Averso's store sells pets like skunks and snakes. Averso has worked in pet stores for 15 years. He opened his new store more than a year ago. He noticed people are interested in unusual pets. They will pay more for them, too. He sells lots of pocket pets. They are small enough to fit in a pocket. Hedgehogs are a kind of pocket pet. New Jersey gave Averso permission to sell skunks. The store has sold 35 skunks. How much for a skunk? It depends on their color and markings. The pet store works with a veterinarian. The vet takes the bad smell out of skunks. He also fixes them so they cannot have babies. Megan Zayatz works at the pet store. She has to clean the skunk cages. She says people think it must be fun to work at the store. They think Zayatz gets to play with animals. But she says she is too busy. Plus, she has to touch animal poop. A girl and her friend came to the store. They said they came from far away. They just wanted to look at the snakes. One of them has a pet snake of her own. One mom wishes she did not buy a pet. She bought her son a lizard. It is called a bearded dragon. So far, the lizard has cost her $500. She was in the store buying food for the lizard. It eats live crickets. The bugs are noisy at night.
