Where the antelope roam once again. SEATTLE, Wash. — For thousands of years, pronghorn antelope lived on the Colville Indian Reservation. The reservation is in Washington state. Pronghorn are fast animals with horns. They look a little like deer. The animals are very important to the Native Americans of the reservation. Pronghorn had died out in Washington 100 years ago. Too many people hunted them. People moving to live in the state bothered them too. Bringing pronghorn antelope back to their lands is tricky. It has been planned for 15 years. Colville scientists brought 52 animals from Nevada. It was not easy to move them. Eleven of the antelope have died. Pronghorn are important for food. They are also an important part of tribal life, said Guy Moura. He works at the Colville reservation. Radio collars were put on the animals. The collars go around their necks.  The collars last for four years. They will help people know where the animals go each day. They will also let them know if any die. The animals were put on large trucks for the ride back to the reservation. It was careful work. Their legs can break easily. The pronghorn now have to get to know their new home. The animals were set free in a grassy area. It has plants that will be good food and cover for the pronghorn. There is water to drink. Moving the pronghorn is part of a big plan. More animals will also be going home. Many people want to help bring back the wildlife of Washington.
