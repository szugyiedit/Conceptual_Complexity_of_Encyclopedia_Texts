In the U.S. Southwest, a federal agency proposed extending protections for Mexican wolves. Two groups are fighting, loudly, over the plan. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20130426_WOLVES.jpg" />ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — In the small, rural community of Reserve, N.M., children waiting for the school bus gather inside cages made of wood and wire. The "kid cages" are there to protect them from wolves. Parents think the cages are perfectly reasonable. Defenders of the wolves note there have been no documented wolf attacks in New Mexico or Arizona. Fears of wolves attacking humans, they say, are overblown. They call the cages nothing more than a stunt. In 1995, Canadian gray wolves were reintroduced into the northern Rockies. People got really angry. Now that anger has flowed into the Southwest. There, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to extend Endangered Species Act protections for an estimated 75 Mexican wolves in the wild in New Mexico and Arizona. Such protections would make it illegal to kill wolves, in most instances. The new federal plan would also significantly expand the area where the wolves would be protected. To many conservatives in the West, such protections are examples of the government going overboard. They see them as idealistic efforts by officials who don’t know what it’s like to live with wolves. “People have to stand up and defend our rights,” said Wink Crigler. She is a fifth-generation rancher from Arizona who says guests at her tourist cabins fear they might be attacked by wolves. Anti-wolf campaigns here often portray the animal as a savage devil preying on children. The campaigns are paid for by conservative political groups. Those groups do not like the federal government. The anger has encouraged scores of illegal killings of Mexican wolves. The population of the animals fell to seven before federal efforts to reintroduce them began in 1998. A young male wolf was fatally shot with an arrow a few weeks ago in the same rural Catron County that uses the kid cages. Into this atmosphere have come federal officials who by the end of the year are expected to finalize their plan for managing Mexican wolves. Those wolves are smaller and browner than Canadian grays. “With the political debate we see raging, we can’t just listen to the loudest voice in the room,” said Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe. “There are many loud voices in the room." No animal stirs up more heated emotions that divide Americans than the wolf does, he explained. He could be describing the situation here: a public policy debate driven not by science but emotional appeals and people fighting for their side. When an Oct. 4 public comment hearing about wolf management was postponed by the government shutdown, supporters came out anyway. They took nearby meeting rooms at an Albuquerque hotel. The Save the Lobo rally, paid for by Defenders of Wildlife, featured a man in a wolf costume. Children drew on signs with crayons and people offered videotaped comments to be forwarded to Washington. Down the hall, the anti-wolf event was sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers. The Kochs are conservatives who support limiting government. The group showed the documentary “Wolves in Government Clothing.” The film said rampaging wolves were like an out-of-control federal government. Said one Arizona rancher at the event: “Is this politically driven? Absolutely.” An armed guard patrolled. Americans for Prosperity said the guard was needed because of death threats from environmental groups. The issue of public safety loomed large. There was a lot of discussion about the kid cages, boxy structures that resemble chicken coops. Photos and video of the cages have been circulated by Americans for Prosperity, although it was unclear how many exist or who requested or paid for them. Local media reports suggest at least some of them were built by students in a high school shop class. Calls to the superintendent of schools in Reserve were not returned. To Carolyn Nelson, a teacher in Catron County, the cages don’t go far enough to protect children. She said that seven years ago her son, then 14, was out walking and came across three wolves. Frightened, he backed against a tree as one wolf stared him down while the other two circled. Only when the boy cocked the gun he was carrying did the wolves run off. “I think it was a miracle he wasn’t killed,” she said. Crigler, the Arizona rancher, who also attended the event, said she understands the fears of the guests in her tourist cabins. “I can’t tell them that they are perfectly safe. There is some degree of risk,” she said, adding that she worries that the wolves are becoming used to people. “They are meat eaters. Savages.” According to wolf researcher Carlos Carroll, who has studied Mexican wolves for the Fish and Wildlife Service, the chances of wolves targeting humans are low. “All we can go on is what has happened in the past,” said Carroll, a conservation biologist with the Klamath Center for Conservation Research in Northern California. “There have been maybe two to three attacks in the last decade, in Canada and Alaska, where there are thousands of wolves.”
