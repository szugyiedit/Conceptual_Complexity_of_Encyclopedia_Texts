Dangerous refuge in Congo park RUMANGABO, Congo — Ndkasi is a big, hairy mountain gorilla. Andre Bauma is a park ranger. Andre treats Ndakasi just like his own child. He rolls in the grass with her. Ndakasi and Andre live in the Virunga National Park. The park is in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a country in Africa. There are about 880 wild mountain gorillas left in the world. About 220 of them live in Virunga National Park. Andre loves his gorillas. He says he wants to stay with them forever. Ndakasi was 2 months old when Andre found her in 2007. Her mother had been shot. Six other Virunga mountain gorillas were killed at the same time. “I felt in my heart that we have to save those babies. This is our job. But it came from my heart,” Andre said. Virunga National Park was set up in 1925. It is the oldest park in Africa. It is also the biggest. Virunga has more animals and plants than any other park in Africa. The park cannot protect all the apes. The great apes have been in danger for years. They face harm from soldiers. A war is going on in Congo. The land is also in danger. People cut down the trees in the park. They use them to make charcoal. The charcoal is used for fires and cooking. People sell the charcoal for money. They spoil the forest for the apes. Companies also want to search for oil in the park. Many of Virunga's gorillas have been killed. Even some of the rangers who try to save the gorillas have been killed. In Congo, some people do not know how to keep nature safe. Andre and the other rangers want to teach the Congolese people. They want the people to love the park for its wildlife.
