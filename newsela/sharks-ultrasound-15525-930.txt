Study uses ultrasound on sharks MIAMI, Fla. — For years, warm shallow waters in the Bahamas have drawn an astonishing number of large tiger sharks. Scientists studying how sharks move around during the year were confused by this pattern. Now a team of scientists may have their answer, thanks in part to a new study method relying on ultrasound. It is the same technology used to see if animals are going to have a baby. The team includes Neil Hammerschlag, a University of Miami shark expert. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/sharkultrasound.png) Hammerschlag first began diving at the site known as Tiger Beach in 2003\. He noticed something surprising. Nearly all the sharks were female. The food tossed into the water by dive tour operators could be the reason for the number of sharks in the area, he said. That did not explain the absence of males, though. So maybe it had something to do with the female sharks having babies, he thought. Little is actually known about how sharks live and love. Part of the problem comes from documenting reproduction, or how sharks make babies. Until now, reproduction studies usually required killing and cutting open sharks. Researchers do not like to do this. So Hammerschlag and co-author James Sulikowsky, of the University of New England, thought about the way humans confirm pregnancies. “When you want to tell if they’re pregnant, you don’t have to kill them, thank goodness,” he said. The scientists wanted to use something like the methods for figuring out if a woman is pregnant. They had to do it at sea, though, with a man-eating 14-foot shark that can weigh as much as 1,400 pounds. Portable, waterproof sonograms made the job easier. Sonograms use sound waves to make images. The portable sonograms are lightweight, easy to maneuver and come with goggles, rather than a screen, to view images. Getting the sharks to keep still was difficult, though. Scientists did not want the sharks to take a bite out of the doctor. Cranky behavior would be understandable, though, given a shark’s 16-month pregnancy period. To catch the sharks, the team baited lines attached to a secure floating drum, which they checked every hour. Once they hooked a shark, the team reeled it in. When the shark was close to the boat, a team member would lasso the shark’s tail and pull it out of the water, essentially disabling the shark’s propeller. Other members then wrestled it aboard an underwater platform. They inserted a 3-inch pipe into its mouth to pump oxygenated saltwater over the shark’s gills. In addition to the sonogram, researchers also drew blood to measure hormone levels. The total exam time is about 20 minutes. While this plan may not sound foolproof, researchers had a few things going for them, Hammerschlag said. First, sharks bite when they’re stressed. The pipe acted like a pacifier. Second, the pumped water had a high oxygen content. This soothed the sharks. “Every now and then (a shark) kind of tenses up and wriggles around, and you let it do what it wants,” he said. Of the 65 sharks caught between 2011 and 2014, 59 were females. Of those, some were pregnant. Younger females were also present, but there were no baby sharks. The area’s shallow sandy bottom provides little for the sharks to eat, but the water is warm and mostly calm. The warm water might also assist in growing the baby inside the mother. That has been seen in nurse sharks, the team reported. Because the area lies within the protected Bahamas Exclusive Economic Zone, the team also believes the findings might show how efforts to protect the tiger sharks have helped. These sharks are considered threatened globally but have begun to rebound in the Atlantic Ocean. Many groups of sharks are getting smaller in the Atlantic, Hammerschlag said. “But it seems tiger sharks are on a recovery trend, and it may be in large part because of the Tiger Beach area,” he said. Asked if anything surprised him during the three-year study, Hammerschlag said, “It amazed me that sometimes the big females are not pregnant. I’d think they were pregnant when in fact they just ate a sea turtle.”
