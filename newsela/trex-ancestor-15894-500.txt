When T. rex was just a runt NEW YORK, N.Y. — The dinosaur T. rex was a big and strong hunter. Its longer name is Tyrannosaurus rex. The T. rex used to be much smaller though. Evolution is the reason for the change. Evolution is an idea about how an animal changes. The changes for T. rex took place over millions of years. Evolution made the dinosaur a bigger and better hunter. Dinosaur bones were found in Asia. They are giving scientists an idea of how the change happened. Some scientists wrote a research paper about the dinosaur bones. Hans-Dieter Sues was one of them. He works for a museum. Stephen Brusatte also worked on the paper. He is a scientist at a university. The bones the scientists found belonged to a dinosaur. It lived about 90 million years ago. It looked like a smaller T. rex. It was 10 to 12 feet long. It only weighed 600 pounds. A long, long time later, a dinosaur like T. rex grew to be 40 feet long. It weighed more than 12,000 pounds. The scientists named the dinosaur Timurlengia euotica. It sounds like TEE'-mer-len-GEE'-uh yoo-OH-tih-kuh. The name is for an Asian king from hundreds of years ago. His name was Tamerlane. Euotica is the scientific name for ears. The dinosaur had special ears. The ears of the early dinosaur showed that it could hear low sounds. This helped it find smaller animals to eat that were nearby. T. rex had similar ears, too. Timurlengia euotica did not have big teeth though. Later, T. rex. had big, scary teeth. The bones show that Timurlengia euotica was small. These bones were from 90 million years ago. It was the size of a horse. About 10 million years later, T-rex bones were very large. This tells scientists that the dinosaur grew bigger in 10 million years. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. is a scientist who studies bones. He said the bone discovery is important. It helps us understand how dinosaurs change. Scientists now know where to dig for more bones.  They can learn more about dinosaur evolution.
