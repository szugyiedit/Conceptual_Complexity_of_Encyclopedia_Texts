Researchers say more efforts are needed to protect Borneo's shrinking orangutan population. ![Image 2\.

This group includes chimpanzees and gorillas. Humans are part of this group, too.  Orangutans only live in a few parts of Southeast Asia. One of these places is an island. It is called Borneo.  Orangutans that live on Borneo are dying in great numbers. Nearly 150,000 have been lost in 16 years, officials said. Forests are being cut down in Borneo. People are using the land to farm. These areas are where orangutans were hurt most.  A group of experts studied the orangutans. Many orangutans were killed by hunters who went into the forest. Others were killed by farmworkers. Farmers killed the apes that came onto their land, a study found. About 70,000 to 100,000 orangutans are left on Borneo, experts say. Their population was cut in half from 1999 to 2015\. Another 45,000 could die in the next 35 years, the experts believe. Serge Wich helped to write the report. He said his team checked their work over and over. They hoped the high numbers were a mistake. Unfortunately, they were the truth, he said.  <img class="centered" alt="Image 3.

Then they can guess how many orangutans there are. From 1999 to 2015, many nests were lost.  The forests of Borneo are being split apart. New farms and buildings are being built. As forests are lost, so too are the orangutans' nests. In these areas, up to three-fourths of the local orangutan populations were lost. In the thicker forests, orangutan numbers fell by half. Most of the apes live in these areas. Hunters in Borneo often go into the forest. They look for pigs and deer. Sometimes they see a large orangutan. They take orangutans for food, too. Female orangutans are sometimes killed for their young. The little ones are sold as pets.  Wich said more people need to know that orangutans are not dangerous. It is against the law to kill them, he said. He said if more people know this, the orangutans could bounce back. Emma Keller works at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The group works to protect different kinds of animals. She said companies are to blame, too. Rain forests are being cut down to make room for palm oil farms. Palm oil is used in all kinds of products. These include snack foods and even lip gloss.  Keller says people can help. They can find out which products have palm oil. They can buy these things from companies that work safely and responsibly, she said.
