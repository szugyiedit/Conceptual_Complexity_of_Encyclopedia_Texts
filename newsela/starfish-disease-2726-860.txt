The five-armed creatures wait to be lifted out for petting. These silent and slow animals don't seem likely to suffer sudden surprises. But last fall, these starfish got a disease that is killing the animals up and down the West Coast. The disease is called sea star wasting syndrome. It is shown by a strange twisting of the starfish's arms and white marks on its skin. The animal dies quickly after its arms fall off and its body softens. The disease has killed huge numbers of sea stars. Scientists are worried by the number of deaths, and they haven't yet found a cause for the illness. The population of starfish on the West Coast is thought to be in the tens of millions. Scientists don’t know how many have died from the disease. But Pete Raimondi, a professor at the University of California, said it could be between tens of thousands and the low millions. Die-offs have happened before, but none as big as this one. The syndrome has been seen as far south as San Diego, nearly 2,500 miles from Anchorage. In Alaska, the disease was first found last summer on Kayak Island. Raimondi was there with a group surveying the sea life living on the coast. They discovered a number of diseased sea stars on the cold island. Scientists had earlier thought that the disease was linked to warmer water. “It was the last place on earth where we would have expected to see it,” Professor Raimondi explained. The group took pictures of the animals and left the island. Then the starfish illness started showing up all over the West Coast. The scientists went to Whittier, Alaska, on Aug. 25. There they found "one sea star twisted and looking deflated." That sea star was so ill that the scientists eventually had to kill the animal to stop its suffering. The museum killed a total of eight suffering starfish between August and November. One sea star lost two arms during one day. Workers at the museum had never seen anything like it. But since November, the disease seems to have vanished again. Greg Danner works at the Museum of Anchorage. He said that it may have helped the starfish when the museum cooled the water in the tanks, but it’s hard to tell. “We’re in the same mystery boat as the rest of the world,” he said. Raimondi said the disease is more common in starfishes kept in aquariums and zoos. This could be a sign that the animals get ill more quickly outside the ocean. He also said that the term “wasting” describes what the disease looks like. This is seen all the time, he said, such as a starfish drying out or getting sick. But Raimondi explained that the sea stars are still getting the disease in the wild. These are not unlucky animals that have been washed up on a beach, they are starfish in their normal homes. The science so far shows that starfish are affected differently depending on where they live. Sea stars in tide pool areas get white marks on their skin first, before their arms start to rot. They can be ill for many weeks before they die. Sometimes, though, they can survive the disease completely. But the disease is much quicker and more deadly when underwater starfish get it. Sea stars that live under the water can lose their arms in hours or a day rather than weeks. Raimondi said scientists are now close to finding the cause of the disease. An infection appears to be the most likely cause, he said. There does not appear to be a link between the disease and the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011. Radiation leaked into the ocean during that disaster in Japan. Some experts had thought this could be the cause of the starfish disease. Yet, if a cause of the disease is found, another problem for the future remains: How do we stop it? “Is it the type of thing that will heal itself over time? That’s the real question,” Raimondi said.
