SeaWorld will keep fewer dolphins ORLANDO, Fla. — There are the usual rides at SeaWorld's Aquatica water park in Florida. There are also four unusual creatures. They are called Commerson’s dolphins. The animals are known for swimming upside down. They are also known for black and white markings that make them look like mini-killer whales. They will probably be the last of their kind in the United States. SeaWorld does not plan to allow the animals to have babies. It also says it will not bring in any more like them.   “Once these animals … go away, that’s going to be it for the species for the SeaWorld parks,” said Brad Andrews, who works at Aquatica. It’s “kind of sad, in a way, because people will never be able to see them anymore.” Not long ago, SeaWorld brought two dolphins from its California park to join two others at Aquatica in Florida. They had not seen each other in years. It was a bittersweet reunion. One died a week after making the trip. There are a few other Commerson's dolphins in captivity in Japan. They are in zoos or parks. However, bringing them to Florida would be difficult. Commerson’s dolphins are still found in oceans in the southern part of the world. However, SeaWorld promised not to take whales or dolphins captured after early 2014. Animal rights supporters say SeaWorld will probably have to stop exhibiting other types of animals soon. Replacing them is becoming too hard. Many animal rights supporters believe these animals should stay in the wild. They do not think animals should be brought to theme parks or zoos. After its last polar bear died in 2014, SeaWorld in Florida did not get another one. The park said it was too difficult. Not long ago, SeaWorld also decided not to bring in beluga whales that were caught in Russia.   SeaWorld says it has had more success breeding other animals. Experts say the Commerson's dolphins are more difficult. "When you start with 12, there’s not enough genetic diversity,” said SeaWorld's Andrews. With an average life of less than 20 years, “they don’t live very long,” he said. “That sort of stopped the program.” Some animal rights supporters say captivity is bad for the dolphins' well-being. They say it explains their short lives and other problems. It’s a sad story, said Nick Atwood. He works for the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida.   SeaWorld, meanwhile, thinks the dolphins have taught people many things. Andrews said SeaWorld has studied the dolphins. He said scientists have learned how the animals act and about their bodies.  In 1983, SeaWorld started with a dozen dolphins from the wild. Scientists wanted SeaWorld to study the animals, which were threatened by fishermen. Since then, the animals have moved from place to place. Some lived and some died. One of those who died was Betsy. She died at the age of 33. Last month Betsy was moved from SeaWorld in California to SeaWorld in Florida. She died within a week. Another dolphin who was brought to Florida with her has done fine.  Some people have questioned why the animals were moved. Atwood from the animal rights group is one of them.  “I think it points to how zoos and aquariums often treat animals as kind of playing cards they can kind of shuffle around," he said.
