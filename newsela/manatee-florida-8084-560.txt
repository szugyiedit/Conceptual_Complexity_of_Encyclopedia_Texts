Florida found the most manatees ever along its coast this year. But the boom may put them in danger of dying off. They may lose protection under rules to save endangered animals. MIAMI — Manatees are large, slow animals that live in the sea. They are also known as sea cows. Many manatees live along the coast of Florida. They are in danger. The number of manatees has gone down over the years. A lot of the danger to manatees has come from humans. Manatees are sometimes hit by boats and die. Manatees have also been dying as a result of pollution. People have been trying to protect manatees. They have made special rules to try to keep manatees from getting hurt. Even so, 828 manatees died in Florida in 2013. Scientists were upset. This was the most deaths ever counted. This year, things look much better. Scientists just counted the number of manatees in Florida. They announced the number on Monday. They counted 6,063 manatees. It was the most manatees they have ever counted. Florida started counting manatees in 1991. It is not easy. Scientists have to go up in airplanes to be able to see the manatees. Scientists try to look at all of Florida's coast in just a few days. “Counting this many manatees is wonderful news,” said Richard Corbett. He tries to protect manatees. Everyone agrees the count is good news. What should people who care about manatees do next? Patrick Rose works at the Save the Manatee Club. He does not think the manatee is completely safe yet. He thinks manatees should still be protected. Other people think that manatees do not need so much protection anymore. They think that manatees are safe enough now. Manatees have been a protected species for more than 100 years. Florida began protecting them in 1893.
