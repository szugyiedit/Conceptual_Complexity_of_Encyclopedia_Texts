Tagged belugas give researchers plenty of surprising data. ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Beluga whales in Alaska eat small fish to live. One of their favorites is cod. The whales will dive deep down to reach them.  Scientists studied the beluga whales. They found that the whales can dive more than 2,950 feet. That is very far. Belugas are small whales with teeth. They are gray when they are born. As they get older they turn white. They have thick fat called blubber. It keeps them warm in cold water. Belugas are hunted by Native Alaskans. The whales are hunted for food. Native Alaskans use all parts of the whales. They even use the fat. Scientists do not know much about what the whales eat. They also do not know much about how they behave. The study helps scientists know more about the whales. This is important because the ocean is changing. The Earth is getting warmer. Some sea ice in Alaska is melting. It is important to know what these changes mean for animals, the scientists said.  Polar bears need sea ice to hunt. They sit on the ice. Beluga whales can move around the ice. Scientists put tags on the whales. The tags tracked them. The tags showed where the whales swam. The tags also showed how deep the whales went in the water.  The scientists tracked belugas for years. They found out where the whales went for food. The waters were once covered year-round with ice. They were trying to learn where the whales go on their long trips. The scientists did not know much about what the whales eat. Still, they found out where they dive. Then they looked at where the cod were. They found a match. The whales dove where there were schools of cod. A school of fish is a big group. The whales dove really deep to get the fish. One beluga went down deeper than 3,000 feet. Scientists do not know why belugas would go so deep. Maybe there were a lot of fish to eat.
