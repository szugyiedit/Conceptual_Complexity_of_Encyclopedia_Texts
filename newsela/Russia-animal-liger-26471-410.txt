One of only 20 ligers in the world Sometimes a lion and tiger come together and something special happens. A baby liger is born.  The liger is a unique animal. It is a mix between a lion and a tiger. They are very uncommon. A baby boy liger was just born at a zoo in Russia. His name is Tsar. It is a Russian word for "king." The zoo is being careful with Tsar. "We don't leave him in a cage," said zoo leader Erik Airapetyan. "It's too cold outside."  Instead, Tsar sleeps inside. He even has a bed. Tsar was born on November 11\. He has orange-brown fur like a young lion. He also has black stripes, like a tiger.  Ligers are very hard to find, says Dmitry Miloserdov. He is a scientist in Russia.  Ligers can grow up and live a long time, Miloserdov said. You just have to take good care of them. The zoo is happy that Tsar is alive. They are giving him anything he wants. He gets lots of milk. Tsar sleeps 16 hours a day. He plays whenever he wants. "We're very proud of our little treasure," Airapetyan said. Tsar weighs about 11 pounds. He is still too small to see his parents, said Airapetyan. Tsar's mother is a tiger. Her name is Princess. Tsar's father is a lion. His name is Caesar. Princess and Caesar live next to each other. They were in a zoo. One day, the zoo opened a wall between their cages. The two big cats met. Soon, the zoo found that Princess was going to have a baby. The baby would be a liger. "Everyone was so happy," Airapetyan said. There are only about 20 ligers in the world, said Airapetyan. Ligers can only be born in zoos, Miloserdov says. This is because almost all wild lions live in Africa. Tigers live in Asia. These are two different continents. Tsar is about as big as a large house cat. "He often sleeps in my arms," said Airapetyan. Tsar will soon grow bigger than his parents.  Another liger lives at a zoo in the United States. His name is Hercules. He is the largest cat in the world. Hercules is almost 11 feet long.
