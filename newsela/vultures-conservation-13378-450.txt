Push is on to save African vultures MAGADI, Kenya — African vultures are having a hard time. Many are dying. There are 11 kinds of vultures in Africa. Four kinds may soon be gone from the world.  Some people in Africa buy body parts of the birds. They think the parts can make sick people better. They think the parts can make children smarter, too. Poachers kill animals for money. They sell the vulture body parts. They make good money. Wild animals sometimes hurt cows. Farmers then lay poison to kill the wild animals. Vultures eat the dead animals. Then the poison kills the vultures, too.  Rhino and elephant poachers also poison vultures. They want to keep the vultures away. Vultures fly above dead animals. Poachers do not want anyone to see that they are poaching rhinos and elephants. There were 10 poisonings between 2011 and 2014 in Africa. About 1,500 vultures died. The Rift Valley is in Kenya. Kenya is a country in Africa. The Rift Valley is home to Rueppell's vulture. The vulture was named for a German scientist. Scientists think the birds have lived in the valley for a long time. They hunt far and wide. They fly high in the sky. Up there, they look like tiny black spots.  There are groups of people that help to protect birds. The groups want to buy the land where the vultures live. They want to turn the land into a preserve. People from the Maasai tribe live there, too. They like the idea of the preserve. The Maasai are herders. They keep cows on the land and watch over them. They would help protect the vultures. People would come to visit the preserve. They would spend money. The money would help the Maasai. There is still hope for Rueppell's vulture.
