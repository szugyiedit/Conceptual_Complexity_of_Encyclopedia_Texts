Nowadays, whales and elephants have babies that are big and grow even bigger. Baby titanosaurs were about as big as human infants, and grew to be bigger than a school bus. WASHINGTON, D.C. — One dinosaur grew faster than any creature ever. The dinosaur is called a titanosaur (tie-TAN-o-SORE). It lived about 67 million years ago. It ate plants. The titanosaur grew to be about 15 feet tall. Its height did not include its head or neck. From head to tail, it was 50 feet long. Titanosaur babies weighed as much as human babies when they were born. They weighed about 6 to 8 pounds. They quickly grew to the size of a golden retriever. Like the dog, titanosaurs weighed about 70 pounds. When they were 20 years old, they were huge. They were as big as a school bus. The dinosaurs grew faster than any creature, said Kristi Curry Rogers. She is a scientist at a college. It is in Minnesota. She studied the baby dinosaur. Some animals are born much bigger than titanosaurs. Whales, elephants and hippos are all much bigger at birth. Jeff Wilson works at the University of Michigan. He said the dinosaurs began as tiny eggs. They grew to be the largest animals on Earth. They were pretty cute too. The looked a little like puppies. They had a short nose, big eyes and a big head, said Luis Chiappe. He runs the Dinosaur Institute. It is at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, California.  Mother dinosaurs laid 20 to 30 eggs at a time. The eggs were as big as softballs. When the babies hatched, they walked, the scientists said. The baby dinosaurs also could live on their own. They would probably run all over the place. It would have been hard for the dinosaur adults to care for them. It would have been even harder for the dinosaur adults to keep track of them all.
