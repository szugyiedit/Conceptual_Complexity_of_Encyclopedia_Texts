Director defends decision ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/CORRECTIONZooGorillaEdit.jpg) CINCINNATI, Ohio — On Monday, the head of the Cincinnati Zoo explained why the zoo decided to kill a gorilla named Harambe. The gorilla was killed to protect a 4-year-old boy. The boy entered the part of the zoo where the gorilla lived. Gorillas are from Africa. They are related to monkeys. This gorilla was killed Saturday by a team of zoo workers. They feared for the boy's safety. Harambe dragged the boy through a moat. Thane Maynard is the head of the zoo. He said the gorilla was confused and angry about the noise in the zoo after the boy fell. Harambe was strong and could hurt the boy badly.  Maynard said the boy climbed over a 3-foot-high bar. He then walked through some bushes and fell 15 feet into a moat. The boy was treated at a hospital. He was released the same day. Maynard said the zoo remains safe. Still, it is looking into how it can be made safer.  Kim O'Connor witnessed the boy's fall. She said that she heard the boy say he wanted to get in the water with the gorillas. The boy's mother was with several other children and told him no. Anthony Seta is an animal rights supporter in Cincinnati. He held a service Monday outside the zoo gates to honor the gorilla. Harambe turned 17 the day before he died. Maynard said the zoo had received messages from around the world. Some of these messages came from other zoo leaders. Visitors have been asking how they could help gorillas. He says that not everyone feels the same way about what happened. They all love animals, though, he said. Many people who write things online think the boy's parents are at fault. Kate Villanueva agrees. She started an online page for Harambe. She also attended Monday's service. "You have to be watching your children at all times," she said. Jack Hanna hosts the television show "Jack Hanna's Into the Wild." He said the zoo made the right decision. Hanna said he saw video of the gorilla dragging the boy through the water. He told WBNS-TV the boy would have been killed if the gorilla wasn't. The zoo said that it's the first time this has happened at its Gorilla World since it opened in 1978\. The exhibit remained closed Monday. Maynard said it could open again next weekend.
