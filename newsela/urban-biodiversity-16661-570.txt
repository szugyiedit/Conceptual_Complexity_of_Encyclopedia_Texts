Nature in the city LOS ANGELES, Calif. — For a long time, snakes, slugs and spiders lived in Los Angeles. Then California got lots of cars and people. Scientists think many critters can still be happy here. They asked people to help them look around. The scientists will open a center to study nature in the city. Living things like plants and animals are natural. "Everybody thinks that Los Angeles is just this big, paved-over place, but it's not," said Lila Higgins. She runs the center's science program. Science is the study of nature.  Scientists asked people to look around for plants and animals. They asked them to take pictures of interesting bugs and plants. Scientists discovered a fly they did not know lived here.  Brian Brown works at the center. He said "there's nothing super-special" about these flies to most people. To the people who study them, the flies are special.   Brown said even though scientists have been studying plants and animals for a long time, we still have a lot to learn. We might know what something is. We do not always know where it came from. Brown said it important to learn where things come from. Brown and Higgins went outside to the garden. The garden is across the street from a school. A train line runs between them. Higgins caught a ladybug with a butterfly net. Brown looked under a bench and named all the bugs he found.  Being curious like this is how the center got started. In 2002, scientists asked people to show them interesting spiders they had found. They quickly got 5,000 spiders. "We thought, 'What else can we do?'" Brown said. Brown said a better world for bugs and plants makes a better place for people. He explained that when bugs and plants break down, the dirt improves. This helps plants. Plants help to clean the air. This makes life better for everyone.
