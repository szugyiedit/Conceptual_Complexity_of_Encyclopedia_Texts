Dogs process language like humans Humans started using dogs as pets more than 15,000 years ago. They trained them using food. Before that, dogs were more like their relative, the wolf. They were wild. Today, people can train dogs easily. They can tell them what to do. Dogs can also tell what people want them to do, by what they say. Scientists already knew this.   Still, scientists did not know that dogs can understand words in the same way people do. A new study proves that they can. A dog's brain looks and thinks about words like humans do. ## Dogs Understand Words Scientists in Europe studied the way dogs listen. It turns out that dogs understand many of the words people say. They also understand the tone. Tone is the way you say the words. To do the study, scientists brought in 13 dogs. The dogs sat for seven minutes in a scanner. The scanner looked at the dogs' brains. Next, the researchers spoke to the dogs. They used happy words like "good job!" They also used words they thought did not mean much to animals. These would be words like "if." They used the happy words and the meaningless words with different tones. It turns out that the dogs understood all the words. It did not matter how the people said the words. They could shout or whisper the same words.  The dogs would still understand what the person meant. It's not possible to trick dogs into being happy by using words that were not happy with a happy voice. Before, scientists thought the dogs might be able to be tricked. ## Dogs Have Always Had This Skill Scientists believe dogs have always had this skill to understand words. They don't think that humans taught this skill to dogs. The research shows we humans are not as special as we like to think. Dogs can understand language, or words, just like us. Humans learn to use words and speak them, though. Our words are still what make people different from other animals.
