SeaWorld in debate on whales' fate SAN DIEGO, Calif. â€” SeaWorld has marine parks around the country. The parks are famous for their whale shows. On Monday, SeaWorld said it will end the shows in San Diego, California. California visitors want to see how the whales act in nature. They do not want to see them do tricks. These whales are also called orcas. Some people were happy about SeaWorld's decision. Yet, they do not think SeaWorld should keep orcas at all. Joel Manby is the head of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. The company runs the three SeaWorld parks. He said the San Diego park will soon have a different kind of orca show. The new show will start in 2017. Visitors will see how the orcas live in the ocean. They will also see how the orcas act there. Adam Schiff is a lawmaker from California. Ending the orca shows is good, he said. Yet, it is not enough. He wants to make a new law about orcas. The law would not allow the park to help the whales give birth to baby orcas in tanks. He said that orcas should not live in tanks. He thinks it is not good for them. Orcas are used to swimming in big areas. Living in tanks can change their behavior. Also, some orcas bite on metal gates. It can break their teeth. The SeaWorld company is not doing as well as it used to. Fewer people are visiting the SeaWorld parks. SeaWorld has not made as much money since a 2013 movie came out. The movie is called "Blackfish." It shows how orcas live in tanks. It also describes Tilikum. The orca caused the death of a trainer in SeaWorld Orlando. The San Diego park has seen the biggest drop in the number of people coming. Orca shows will be stopped only in San Diego. They will continue at the other two SeaWorld parks. They are in in San Antonio, Texas, and Orlando, Florida. SeaWorld wants to make their orca tanks bigger in San Diego. It will spend $100 million on the project. SeaWorld hopes it will get more people to come. The project is called Blue World.
