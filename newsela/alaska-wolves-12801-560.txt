Mill vs. wolf in Alaskan forest Loggers are cutting down thousands of giant trees in Alaska. The trees grow in Tongass National Forest. It is on Prince of Wales Island. Tongass is America's largest forest. Some of the trees are 800 years old. They are more than 200 feet tall. Sawmills are cutting up the logs. Government officials say the logging is important for people on the island. Only one large sawmill is still open. About 50 people work there. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20151028_ALASKA_WOLVES.png" /> Yet not everyone is happy about the logging. The number of Alexander Archipelago wolves are going down. Cutting down more trees may make them die off even faster. The wolves make their dens in the roots of very large trees. They eat deer that live in the forest. Just 20 years ago, about 300 wolves lived on the island. Now, only about 50 remain. There is about one wolf for every person working in the sawmill. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is part of the government. It is deciding whether the wolf is in danger. If it is, the department could the stop logging and hunting, or allow less of it. Right now there is a plan to keep the logging going. Loggers can cut down just enough old trees to keep the sawmills running. These trees are old growth. An old-growth forest grows over a long time. In a young-growth forest, saplings are planted to replace trees that have been cut down. The loggers then wait for younger trees to grow. In a few years they will cut those down instead of the old-growth trees. Owen Graham is the head of the Alaska Forest Association. Logging and sawmill companies belong to the group. Graham said they do not need to cut down many old trees. They need just enough trees to last 30 years. Then they can cut down young-growth trees. The government said most of the old trees are still standing, he said. Environmental experts say the old-growth trees should not be cut down. It puts wildlife and the forest at risk. Larry Edwards works for Greenpeace. It is an environmental group. He said there must be a way to stop cutting down the old trees. He said the wolves and the environment should be saved.
