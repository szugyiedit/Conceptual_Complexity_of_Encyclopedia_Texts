A federal agency wants to extend protections for Mexican wolves in New Mexico and Arizona. The debate over the matter is driven more by emotion than science. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20130426_WOLVES.jpg" />ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — In the small, rural community of Reserve, N.M., children waiting for the school bus gather inside wooden and mesh cages. The "kid cages" are there to protect them from wolves and are considered a reasonable precaution by parents. Defenders of the wolves note there have been no documented wolf attacks in New Mexico or Arizona. Fears of wolves attacking humans, they say, are overblown. They call the cages nothing more than a stunt. In 1995, Canadian gray wolves were reintroduced into the northern Rockies, igniting a furor. Now that acrimony has cascaded into the Southwest, where the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to extend Endangered Species Act protections for an estimated 75 Mexican wolves in the wild in New Mexico and Arizona. Such protections would make it illegal to kill wolves, in most instances. The new federal plan would also significantly expand the area where the wolves could roam unmolested. To many conservatives in the West, such protections are examples of government overreach. They see them as idealistic efforts by officials who don’t know what it’s like to live with wolves. “People have to stand up and defend our rights,” said Wink Crigler, a fifth-generation rancher from Arizona who says guests at her tourist cabins fear they might be attacked by wolves. Anti-wolf campaigns here often portray the animal as a savage devil preying on children. The campaigns are paid for by conservative political organizations antagonistic toward the federal government. The antipathy has encouraged scores of illegal killings of Mexican wolves, whose population dwindled to seven before federal efforts to reintroduce them began in 1998. A young male wolf was fatally shot with an arrow a few weeks ago in the same rural Catron County that uses the kid cages. Federal officials are expected to finalize their plan for managing Mexican wolves, a smaller and tawnier subspecies of the Canadian grays, by the end of this year. “With the political debate we see raging, we can’t just listen to the loudest voice in the room,” said Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe. “There are many loud voices in the room. No animal engenders more polarizing emotion among Americans than does the wolf.” He could be describing the situation here: a public policy debate driven not by science but emotional appeals and pure partisanship. When a previously scheduled Oct. 4 public comment hearing about wolf management was postponed by the government shutdown, advocates came out anyway, staking out nearby meeting rooms at an Albuquerque hotel. The Save the Lobo rally, paid for by Defenders of Wildlife, featured a man in a wolf costume. Children drew on placards with crayons and people offered videotaped testimony to be forwarded to Washington. Down the hall, the anti-wolf event was sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, an organization funded by the billionaire conservative Koch brothers. The group screened the documentary “Wolves in Government Clothing,” which equated rampaging wolves with an out-of-control federal government. Said one Arizona rancher at the event: “Is this politically driven? Absolutely.” An armed guard patrolled, made necessary, Americans for Prosperity said, by death threats from environmental groups. The issue of public safety loomed large, with much discussion of the kid cages, boxy structures that resemble chicken coops. Photos and video of the cages have been circulated by Americans for Prosperity, although it was unclear how many exist or who requested or paid for them. Local media reports suggest at least some of them were built by students in a high school shop class. Calls to the superintendent of schools in Reserve were not returned. To Carolyn Nelson, a teacher in Catron County, the cages don’t go far enough to protect children. She said that seven years ago her son, then 14, was out walking and came across three wolves. Frightened, he backed against a tree as one wolf stared him down while the other two circled. Only when the boy cocked the gun he was carrying did the wolves run off. “I think it was a miracle he wasn’t killed,” she said. Crigler, the Arizona rancher, who also attended the event, said she understands the fears of the guests in her tourist cabins. “I can’t tell them that they are perfectly safe. There is some degree of risk,” she said, adding that she worries that the wolves are becoming used to people. “They are meat eaters. Savages.” According to wolf researcher Carlos Carroll, who was among the scientists studying Mexican wolves for the Fish and Wildlife Service, the probability of wolves targeting humans is low. “All we can go on is what has happened in the past,” said Carroll, a conservation biologist with the Klamath Center for Conservation Research in Northern California. “There have been maybe two to three attacks in the last decade, in Canada and Alaska, where there are thousands of wolves.”
