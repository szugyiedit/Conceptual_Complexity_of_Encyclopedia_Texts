Zenkerella, world's most ancient and mysterious mammal, is rediscovered A Zenkerella looks like a squirrel. It has fluffy black fur and a tail. Part of its tail has scales. The Zenkerella live on Bioko Island. It is in Equatorial Guinea, a country in Africa. They are one of the oldest animals on Earth. They have changed very little in 49 million years. The Zenkerella is the last member of an ancient animal family. The other animals in its family have died out. Three dead Zenkerellas have been caught. Scientists are very excited. They mainly knew about the Zenkerellas from their bones. They never saw a live Zenkerella or even a dead one. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/zenkerella.jpg) David Fernandez is a scientist. He was the head of a wildlife center on Bioko Island. Dr. Fernandez cannot believe Zenkerellas were found. He said it was an amazing discovery. Scientists do not know much about them. They do not know how many Zenkerellas there are. They do not know where they live on the island. Scientists do not know if they spend their time in trees or on the ground. They do not even know what Zenkerellas eat. Eric Seiffert is another scientist. He studies ancient bones at the University of Southern California. He became interested in the Zenkerella. He knew they lived on Bioko. He asked Dr. Fernandez to help him find one. Almost a year later, Dr. Fernandez got a call. A person said he found a dead one. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/Zenkerella_Bioko.png) The scientists are to trying to learn more about it. They are looking at the animals' stomachs. They are hoping to find food that the Zenkerellas ate. The food will show the scientists what Zenkerellas eat. It may also show them where the Zenkerellas live. Dr. Seiffert really hopes to see a live one. He thinks scientists will learn about how the animal changed over time. It may also teach them how Africa has changed. Even a dead Zenkerella is amazing, Seiffert said. It shows that scientists have not discovered everything. There are new discoveries waiting to be made.
