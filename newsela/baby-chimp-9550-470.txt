Florida zoo adopts baby chimp Keeva is a baby chimpanzee. She was born on March 12 at the Maryland Zoo. Keeva had a problem. Her mom, Carole, did not seem to be ready for the job of being a mom. Carole was not mean to Keeva. She was not trying to hurt her. Yet she was not doing much of anything with her baby. She was not taking care of her. The zookeepers kept Keeva and Carole apart for a while. Then they put them back together again. They hoped Carole would feel a little more like a mother. This plan did not go as hoped. So the people at the zoo took good care of Keeva. They fed her and held her. They made her feel loved and safe. They even wore fur vests. They wanted her to think that chimps were taking care of her. The zoo staff started to look for a new home for Keeva. They wanted a place where Keeva could be raised by chimps. There is a zoo in Florida called the Lowry Park Zoo. A chimp named Abby lives there. Abby has raised two adopted chimp babies. Sadly, there was no chimp like this in Maryland. So when Keeva was 3 weeks old, a plane flew her to a new home. Keeva is now living at the Lowry Park Zoo. Lucky for her. If Keeva had been born in the wild, she probably would have died. So far, Keeva seems fine in her new home. She is in her own space. Right now, she can see Abby through a screen. They seem to get along. The other chimps have also been keeping an eye on her. They are curious about the new, little chimp. She is watching them too. Not long ago, Keeva made her first sound at her adoptive family. The other chimps answered her. This is a good sign. Keeva should be ready to move in with her new chimp family soon. And people will be able to come visit.
