Mill vs. wolf in Alaskan forest The story of the wolves, the island and the ancient forest in Alaska began a long time ago. This spring, with the approval of the U.S. Forest Service, loggers began cutting thousands of acres of old-growth evergreens in Tongass National Forest in Prince of Wales Island in Alaska. An old-growth forest has developed over a long time without significant destruction from fires or logging. Some of the giant spruce, hemlock and cedar are 800 years old and more than 200 feet tall. It is one of the largest and most controversial timber sales in two decades. State and federal officials say the sale is essential to the livelihoods of people on the island. The last remaining large sawmill there employs about 50 people. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20151028_ALASKA_WOLVES.png" /> Yet the Alexander Archipelago wolf population has been declining. And cutting down more trees is expected to make them die off even faster. The animals make their dens in the roots of very large trees and prey on deer that live in the forest. Roads built for logging cause problems too. They divide animal habitats and make it easier for hunters to shoot and trap wolves, sometimes illegally. Just 20 years ago, Prince of Wales was home to about 300 wolves. Now, state officials estimate that as few as 50 remain — about one wolf for every person working in the sawmill. By the end of this year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to make a final decision on whether the wolf should be listed as an endangered species. Meanwhile, logging continues, and so does hunting — of both wolves and the deer that they eat. “They’re logging up a storm out there,” said Owen Graham. He is the head of the Alaska Forest Association, which represents timber businesses. “They’re trying to get wood ahead of the winter.” But all that could come to an end if the wolf is declared endangered. Government officials could reduce or stop logging and hunting if they decide that the wolves are becoming extinct. At the heart of the debate in southeast Alaska is the so-called Tongass transition plan. The Forest Service has described it as a plan to help the timber business change. It provides just enough old-growth timber to keep the region’s few remaining sawmills running. Meanwhile, the industry will wait for younger trees to grow and then switch over to those. The timber industry in southeast Alaska is a fraction of what it was before new federal regulations began limiting old-growth logging in the 1990s. There are fewer than 300 logging and sawmill jobs in the region, compared with the 3,500 workers two decades ago. While the industry has shrunk, others, including tourism and fishing, have grown. Forrest Cole is the Tongass forest supervisor. In 2013 he announced the Big Thorne Project, the name of the current logging project on Prince of Wales. By cutting down old growth trees, sawmills get a regular supply of timber. The project gives the Forest Service and the timber industry "the breathing space" needed to prepare for switching over to young-growth timber. In other words, the timber industry can cut down a limited number of old trees now while it waits for younger ones to grow. Lumber mills on Prince of Wales were built to cut larger, older trees. The younger, second-growth trees are shipped to Asia and milled there more cheaply. The Forest Service has said Big Thorne would provide enough old-growth trees to keep the mill busy for six to 10 years. However, timber industry leaders say there may be enough timber to last only three or four years. The mill on Prince of Wales is seen as important because it provides year-round work, while logging jobs are seasonal. “We don’t need a lot of it,” Graham said of the old-growth forest. He noted that the Forest Service says 90 percent of old growth in the Tongass remains standing. “We just need enough to get us through these next 30 years, maybe 2 (percent) or 3 percent of it. There’s plenty of room to have a few sawmills with year-round jobs and still have this last old-growth forest out there untouched.” Conservation experts say logging old-growth trees to save sawmills is misguided. It puts wildlife and the forest at risk to preserve a few dozen timber jobs. Larry Edwards works for the environmental organization Greenpeace. He said there must be a way to change over to cutting down new growth trees "in a way that makes sense" instead of destroying the wolves and the environment.
