Researchers say more efforts are needed to protect Borneo's shrinking orangutan population. ![Image 2.

The island is split between three countries: Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Orangutans on Borneo are now facing a major threat from humans.  Hunting and killing have driven a dramatic decline in the orangutan population there. Nearly 150,000 orangutans have been lost from the island’s forests in 16 years, conservationists warn. Conservationists work to protect wildlife and their habitats.  The steepest losses occurred in regions where the forest has been cut down to make way for palm oil and acacia plantations. Palm oil is an extremely versatile resource, found in everything from snack foods to lip gloss. Demand for palm oil has been causing major deforestation in tropical regions. Sap from acacia trees has many uses as well, including paints, candies and even fireworks.  Many animals were also killed by hunters who ventured into the forest, or by farmworkers when the apes came onto their land, a study found. Researchers estimate that the number of orangutans left on Borneo now stands at between 70,000 and 100,000\. That means the population more than halved over the study period, which ran from 1999 to 2015\. Without new efforts to protect the animals, the numbers could fall at least another 45,000 in the next 35 years, the conservationists predict. The real decline could be worse, however. The prediction is based only on habitat loss and did not include killings. The bleak assessment of the state of the Bornean apes comes from an international team of conservationists. They assembled one of the most far-reaching reports yet on the animals.  In 2016, orangutans were declared “critically endangered.” This designation is made by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). <img class="centered" alt="Image 3.

He is a co-author of the report at Liverpool John Moores University. “When we did the analyses, we ran them again and again to figure out if we had made a mistake somewhere. You think the numbers can’t be that high, but unfortunately, they are.” The researchers studied 16 years of ground and helicopter surveys. The surveys had recorded the numbers and locations of nests that orangutans built in the trees from branches and leaves. The nests are used to estimate the sizes of orangutan populations because the animals themselves are so elusive and hard to find. Writing in the journal Current Biology, the team described how the decline in nests from 1999 to 2015 points to the stunning loss of 148,500 orangutans in Borneo. The team identified 64 separate groups of orangutans on the island. However, only 38 are thought to include more than 100 individuals. That is the minimum number considered to be practical for a group's survival. The forests of Borneo are being split apart by new plantations and building projects. This is called forest fragmentation. The resulting loss of trees led to falls in local orangutan populations of up to 75 percent, the study found. In the dense forests, orangutan numbers fell 50 percent. While that is a lower rate, it amounts to more animals because most of the apes live in these areas. “This is the biggest chunk of the loss,” said Maria Voigt at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. “More than 70 percent of the orangutans lost are in the forest.” Hunters in Borneo tend to enter the forest to find pigs and deer, but if they encounter a large orangutan, they can take the animals for food. Female orangutans are occasionally killed for their young, which are sold off as pets. Far more of the apes die when they venture on to plantations and into people’s gardens, where they are shot or killed with machetes. Last week, authorities on Borneo found the body of a male orangutan. It had machete scars and wounds from 130 airgun pellets. “We need to work with people to help them understand that orangutans are not dangerous and that it’s illegal to kill them,” Wich said. He has one idea for an approach: to have famous Indonesians and Malaysians raise awareness of orangutans through social media. “We know this decline has been largely due to hunting, and if we can turn that around, these orangutans could, over a long period, bounce back. When you lost the habitat, it’s gone forever, but the forests are still there. If we can stop the hunting and killing, we can reverse the trend.” “Orangutans are disappearing at an alarming rate," said Emma Keller at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a nonprofit group. "Hunting threatens the existence of this magnificent great ape." Their forest homes have been lost and hurt, she said.  "Immediate action is needed to reform industries that have pushed orangutans to the brink of extinction. Consumers can make a difference through only supporting brands and retailers that buy sustainable palm oil,” Keller added.
