Dogs' DNA shows East Asia origins People and dogs have been living together for hundreds of years. When did dogs and people become friends? Where do dogs even come from? A group of scientists tried to answer these questions. They just completed a study about the history of dogs. The study examines dogs' DNA.  DNA is the building block of life. It tells your body how to grow and work. It is passed on from parents to their children.  The scientists looked at the DNA of dogs all over the world. Dogs, like humans, share DNA with their relatives. The scientists put together a big family tree for dogs. It went all the way back to the animal's beginning. In this way, the scientists learned about the history of dogs. The first dogs, they learned, lived in Asia. They were born about 33,000 years ago. At first, there were only about 6,400 of them. Their parents were wolves. The new study answers many questions. It raises some, too. For example, what caused wolves in Asia to become dogs all those years ago? One idea is that wolves in Asia became cut off from each other. Then, a group of South Chinese wolves were on their own. They did not mix with other groups, and their DNA slowly changed. Perhaps these South Chinese wolves eventually became dogs. After that, dogs became "man's best friend." Or it could have happened the other way around. It is possible that some wolves started living with people before they became dogs. Living with people led to many changes for these wolves. It changed their DNA, and their offspring became dogs. In other words, it is possible that dogs were our friends before they were even dogs. By studying DNA, scientists now have a much better understanding of the history of dogs. There is still much to learn, though. How exactly dogs came to be remains unclear.
