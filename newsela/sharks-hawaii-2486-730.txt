Two men were killed last year in shark attacks. Many believe both got attacked by tiger sharks, considered one of the fiercest sharks. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140117_HAWAII_SHARKS.jpg" />MAKENA STATE PARK, Hawaii — There was a record number of shark attacks in the islands of Hawaii last year. So Colin Dececco thought about sharks as he walked along the beach. Dececco and his daughter saw a shark while swimming at Makena Big Beach. It's on Maui, which is one of the islands that make up Hawaii. Later on they watched a fisherman at the same spot. Suddenly they heard a big splash coming from his net. It was an 8-foot-long tiger shark. The tiger shark is one of the fiercest sharks around. It is probably responsible for most of the 14 attacks in Hawaii in 2013. Eight of these happened near Makena Beach. The fisherman let go of his net and ran down the shore, shouting for swimmers to get out of the water. “By then everyone was kind of running,” Dececco said. “Tiger sharks — you don’t play with them.” Tourism is a very important business in Hawaii. So the increase in shark attacks has worried both visitors and business owners. Two people died in 2013 — a German snorkeler and a fisherman from Washington state. Both attacks happened near Maui's Makena State Park. The state posts notices and closes the beach right after a shark attack. The beach stays shut until noon the next day. Officials in helicopters check that the shark has left the area. Then they open the beach again. For now, they see no need to change how they do things. In 2013 the state announced a new study by the University of Hawaii. It will last for two years. This study will look into whether tiger sharks spend more time around Maui than the other islands of Hawaii. The study will try to see if the sharks are coming to Maui because of all the tourists. The number of attacks in Hawaii increased in both 2013 and 2012. In the three years before that there were just three attacks each year. So far the attacks have not affected tourism. More than 2.1 million people visited Maui last year. But many swimmers are changing what they do. Some visitors said they will not swim very far out to sea because they are scared of the sharks. Hawaii native Lorraine Alesna has fished in Maui for many years. She shook her head at some of the visitors to her island. Some of the tourists zoomed into the water without thinking. Sharks produce their babies during the winter months. Attacks on humans are more likely at this time. So visitors to Hawaii should be more careful in the water during the winter. People should also avoid cloudy water that attracts the sharks. But, not everybody does. Alesna said that the tourists have no respect for the ocean. “We grew up knowing what we can and cannot do in certain times of the year,” she said. Alesna has lots of theories for the rise in shark attacks. She thinks that sharks might be coming closer to the beach to eat green sea turtles. The turtles were in danger of dying out. But they have been protected by law since 1978. So now there are more turtles in the waters around Hawaii. But Carl Meyer said there was no evidence to support this. Meyer is a scientist at the University of Hawaii. He will be leading the new study. Meyer says that turtles are just one of many things that tiger sharks eat. These sharks will swallow anything and everything they can find. So they are known as the “garbage cans” of the ocean. Car license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs have all been found in the stomachs of tiger sharks. Many people think there are more tiger sharks in the water now. Or maybe they are hungrier than before. Meyer doesn't agree with these theories. But the scientist does know that there are more people in the ocean than ever before. So he will now look at whether there are more tiger sharks where there are more people.
