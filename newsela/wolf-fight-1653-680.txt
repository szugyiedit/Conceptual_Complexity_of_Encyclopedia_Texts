Kids wait in cages for the school bus. Some say they're being protected from wolves. Others call it a stunt, pointing out there have been no recorded wolf attacks in the area. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20130426_WOLVES.jpg" />ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Children in Reserve, N.M., wait for the school bus inside cages made of wood and wire. The "kid cages" are there to protect them from wolves. The town is small and away from the city. Parents think the cages are a good idea. Defenders of the wolves see it another way. They note there have been no recorded wolf attacks in New Mexico or Arizona. They say the cages are just a stunt. In 1995, Canadian gray wolves were reintroduced into the northern Rockies. People got really angry. Now that anger has moved into the Southwest. The U.S. government wants to extend protection for an estimated 75 Mexican wolves. The animals live in the wild in New Mexico and Arizona. They are smaller and browner than Canadian grays. The government would make it against the law to kill wolves. The new plan would also make the area where the wolves would be protected much bigger. Conservatives in the West do not like the plan. They say the officials who came up with the plan don’t know what it’s like to live with wolves. “People have to stand up and defend our rights,” said Wink Crigler. She is a rancher from Arizona. Crigler says guests at her tourist cabins are afraid. They think they might be attacked by wolves. Anti-wolf groups here often show the animal as a savage devil preying on children. The campaigns are paid for by conservative political groups. Those groups do not like the federal government. Many Mexican wolves have been killed because of the anger. The killings are against the law. The number of Mexican wolves fell to seven in the late 1990s. A young male wolf was killed by an arrow a few weeks ago. The shooting happened in the same county that uses the kid cages. U.S. officials are putting together a plan for managing Mexican wolves. They are expected to be finished by the end of the year. An Oct. 4 public comment hearing about wolf management was postponed by the government shutdown. But supporters of each side came out anyway. They took over meeting rooms in a nearby hotel. The Save the Lobo rally was paid for by Defenders of Wildlife. It featured a man in a wolf costume. Down the hall, the anti-wolf event was sponsored by Americans for Prosperity. The group gets money from the conservative Koch brothers. The group screened the movie “Wolves in Government Clothing.” The film said rampaging wolves were like an out-of-control federal government. The issue of public safety was a big deal. There was a lot of discussion about the kid cages. The cages look like chicken coops. Photos and video of the cages have been sent around by Americans for Prosperity. But it is not clear how many cages exist. Who requested or paid for them? Local media reports suggest at least some of them were built by students in a high school shop class. Calls to the superintendent of schools in Reserve were not returned. Carolyn Nelson is a teacher in Catron County. She thinks the cages don’t go far enough to protect children. She said that seven years ago her son, then 14, was out walking. He came across three wolves. Frightened, he backed against a tree as one wolf stared him down while the other two circled. The boy cocked the gun he was carrying. Then the wolves ran off. “I think it was a miracle he wasn’t killed,” she said. Carlos Carroll says the chances of wolves targeting people is low. He is one of the scientists studying Mexican wolves for the Fish and Wildlife Service. “All we can go on is what has happened in the past,” said Carroll. Only two or three attacks have happened in the past 10 years and they were in Alaska and Canada. There are thousands of wolves in those places, he said.
