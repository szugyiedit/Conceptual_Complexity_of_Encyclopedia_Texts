Mill vs. wolf in Alaskan forest This spring, loggers began cutting down thousands of acres of giant trees in Alaska. The trees grew in the Tongass National Forest on Prince of Wales Island. It is America's largest forest. Some of the spruce, hemlock and cedar trees are 800 years old and more than 200 feet tall. The timber is being sent to sawmills to be cut up. It is one of the largest timber sales in 20 years. Many people are unhappy about it. State and government officials say the project is necessary to keep people working on the island. The last remaining large sawmill there has about 50 workers. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20151028_ALASKA_WOLVES.png" /> Yet the Alexander Archipelago wolf population has been declining. Cutting down more trees is expected to make them die off even faster. The wolves make their dens in the roots of very large trees. They prey on deer that live in the forest. Roads built for logging cause problems too. They divide animal habitats. They also make it easier for hunters to shoot and trap wolves, sometimes against the law. Just 20 years ago, about 300 wolves lived on the island. Now, state officials estimate that as few as 50 remain. There is about one wolf for every person working in the sawmill. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is deciding whether the wolf should be listed as an endangered species. Meanwhile, logging continues, and so does hunting. “They’re logging up a storm out there,” said Owen Graham. He is the head of the Alaska Forest Association. Logging and sawmill companies belong to the group. “They’re trying to get wood ahead of the winter.” All that could stop if the wolf is declared endangered. Government officials could reduce or end logging and hunting. At the heart of the debate is the Tongass transition plan. Under the plan, loggers can cut down just enough old-growth trees to keep the sawmills running. An old-growth forest has developed over a long time without much destruction from fires or logging. Eventually, loggers will only cut down what are called young-growth trees. These are younger trees planted to replace others that have been cut down. In other words, timber companies can cut down some old trees now. Meanwhile, it waits for younger ones to grow. The timber business in southeast Alaska is far smaller than it was in the 1990s. Government rules began limiting the number of old-growth trees that could be cut down. There are fewer than 300 logging and sawmill jobs in the region. Twenty years ago, there were 3,500 workers. Lumber mills on Prince of Wales were built to cut larger, older trees. The younger, second-growth trees are shipped to Asia and cut there more cheaply. The Forest Service of the U.S. government has said the project would provide enough old-growth trees to keep the mill busy for six to 10 years. However, timber company leaders say there may be enough trees to last only three or four years. The mill on Prince of Wales is important. Workers there are able to work all year round. Often loggers only get work for a few months at a time. “We don’t need a lot of it,” Graham said of the old-growth forest. He is the head of the Alaska Forest Association. He noted that the Forest Service says that most of the old-growth trees have not been cut down. “We just need enough to get us through these next 30 years," he said. "There’s plenty of room to have a few sawmills with year-round jobs and still have this last old-growth forest out there untouched.” Environmental experts say cutting down old-growth trees to save sawmills is a bad idea. It puts wildlife and the forest at risk. Larry Edwards works for Greenpeace, an environmental group. He said there must be a way to change over to new growth trees without destroying the wolves and the environment.
