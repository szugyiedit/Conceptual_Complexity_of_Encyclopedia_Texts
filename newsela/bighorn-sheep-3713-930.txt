“There was a lot of concern about extinction,” says the recovery project leader. But thanks to "the right recovery efforts, it’s gone as well as anybody could’ve imagined.” <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140428_BIGHORN_SHEEP.jpg" />FRESNO, Calif. — Fifteen years ago, things were looking bad for the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. There were just 105 of them scattered across the mountain range from which they take their name. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, 14 sheep were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, located high in the mountains in Sequoia National Park. Nine of the sheep were pregnant. The park's new arrivals are big news: It’s the first time bighorn sheep have settled in this part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in more than 100 years. It proves that the species can be saved from [extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) — that is, from dying out completely. Coming back from near extinction is known as _recovery_. “This shows that recovery is actually" possible, says biologist Daniel Gammons. “Most species that end up on the endangered species list don’t ever come off." However, "there’s a real opportunity here to see success.” It’s taken more than 10 years of research to make it happen. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands. Then, in the 1800s, settlers started crossing the mountain range, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. “There was a lot of concern about extinction,” says recovery project leader Tom Stephenson. But thanks to "the right recovery efforts, it’s gone as well as anybody could’ve imagined.” In 2000, teams of biologists began their research. In 2007, they started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn by placing them into herds along the Sierra crest. Sixteen areas were selected for the bighorns, though the plan was to start with only 12. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March is the 10th herd so far. Recovery efforts date back to the 1970s. At that point, the bighorn population had declined to just one area — Wheeler Ridge on the northern edge of Kings Canyon. The herd there became the source population for recovery efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. Now, new herds are being created by taking a few sheep at a time from four source herds. These herds are large enough to lose several animals. Because ewes only give birth to one lamb per year, the growth of new herds is slow. Stephenson believes it will be another 10 years before 12 herds are repopulated. Currently, the estimated 500 bighorn sheep are roughly half females and half males. The goal is to have 305 females among the entire population. Spotting a bighorn in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack. Their camouflage-like fur makes them masters of disguise: They simply blend in with the rocky and snowy mountainsides of the high country. Bighorns use their excellent vision to spot predators. They then use the rugged rocks as a means of escape: Few animals can scurry up a steep and craggy mountainside as fast as they can. Bighorns can live anywhere from 11,000 to 14,000 feet in the warmer months, Stephenson says. During the coldest months, the sheep may migrate to as low as 6,000 feet. The animals that are relocated are captured with net guns fired out of circling helicopters. Each bighorn is captured individually. It is examined, fitted with a collar transmitter and then placed in a box to be flown to a particular herd. There are some concerns about California's drought. One in the mid-1990s significantly cut into the population. But Stephenson and his team hope that the way the herds are being spread out will allow the sheep to continue to grow in numbers. Recreational use of the parks has not been affected by the project. However, regular sheep grazing has been banned to ensure the health of the bighorns. Grazing sheep have sometimes passed diseases to bighorn herds. Bighorns, for example, have caught pinkeye and a deadly lung illness called pneumonia.
