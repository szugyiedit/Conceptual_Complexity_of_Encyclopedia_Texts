SeaWorld will keep fewer dolphins ORLANDO, Fla. — SeaWorld is in the state of Florida. It has rides. It has animals, too. There are four rare dolphins. They are called Commerson's dolphins. The dolphins swim upside down. They have black and white markings. They look like mini-killer whales.  These dolphins might be the last of their kind in the country. SeaWorld will not try to make them have babies. It will not bring in any more dolphins like them.   Brad Andrews works at SeaWorld in Florida. He feels sad. "People will never be able to see them anymore," he said. Not long ago, SeaWorld brought in two more dolphins. They were from its park in the state of California. They joined the dolphins in Florida. They had not seen each other in many years. One of the dolphins died a week after making the trip. There are a few other Commerson's dolphins in zoos in Japan. It would be hard to bring them to Florida. Japan is very far away. There are other Commerson’s dolphins in the world's seas. SeaWorld has promised not to take them.   People who support animal rights want these animals to stay in the wild. They do not think they should be in parks or zoos. They say SeaWorld might have to stop showing them soon. It is becoming too hard to get more of them.   SeaWorld says scientists have learned many things from the dolphins. Regular people have learned about them too. SeaWorld thinks this is a good thing.
