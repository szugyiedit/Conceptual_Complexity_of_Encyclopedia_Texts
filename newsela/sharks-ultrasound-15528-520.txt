Study uses ultrasound on sharks MIAMI, Fla. — Scientists were puzzled. Many tiger sharks were coming to waters near the Bahamas each year. The area is called Tiger Beach. The water there is warm and shallow. Now a team of scientists may have the answer. They used pictures made from sound to figure it out. This is called ultrasound. Shark expert Neil Hammerschlag is one of the scientists. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/sharkultrasound.png) Hammerschlag began diving and swimming in Tiger Beach in 2003\. He noticed something surprising. Nearly all the sharks were female. Why weren't there any males? Maybe it had something to do with having babies, he thought. Scientists do not know much about how sharks have babies. Until now, scientists had to kill and cut open sharks to study how they have babies. Scientists do not like to do this. So Hammerschlag and another scientist had an idea. They thought about how you tell if a human is having a baby. You do not have to kill humans to tell if they are pregnant, Hammerschlag said. "Thank goodness."  The job was tougher than examining a human. The scientists had to do their work in the water. They were examining a man-eating shark. The shark is 14 feet long. It can weigh 1,400 pounds. A shark is also pregnant for 16 months. Waterproof ultrasound machines made the job easier. The machines use sound waves to make pictures. They were easy to move. Scientists also have goggles to view pictures. Getting the sharks to keep still was difficult. Scientists did not want the sharks to bite the doctor. First the team put bait on fishing lines. The lines were attached to a floating drum. Once a shark was hooked, the team pulled it in. They had to wait until the shark was close to the boat. Then a team member would rope the shark’s tail and pull it out of the water. Other members then pulled it onto an underwater platform. They put a pipe into its mouth. The pipe would pump water with extra oxygen over its gills. The exam took about 20 minutes. The pipe acted like a pacifier, calming the shark. Sharks bite when they are not calm. The extra oxygen in the pumped water also relaxed the sharks. Scientists caught 65 sharks between 2011 and 2014\. Most were females. Some were pregnant. The sharks might feel safe at Tiger Beach, the scientists said. The warm water might also help the baby grow inside the mother, they said.
