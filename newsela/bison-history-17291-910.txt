Nearly wiped out in a bid to demolish Native American resistance, the bison’s history paints a picture of strife and redemption that mirrors the U.S.’s own The United States has chosen its first national mammal: the bison. Also known as a buffalo, it will represent the country along with the bald eagle. Just over 100 years ago, bison were almost completely gone from the U.S. A bison can weigh 2,000 pounds. It stands 6 feet tall, has a coarse beard and a pair of curved horns. Congressman William Clay supports the bison and says that no other native species tells America’s story.  At least 30 million bison once roamed the land that is now the U.S. President George Washington once shot a bison in what is currently West Virginia. Then, settlers moved west and bison were killed by hunters and disease. Within a century, the numbers dropped steeply, and by 1889, just over 1,000 bison were left. The U.S. Army wiped out the bison in order to break the will of the Native American tribes. Native Americans relied on the animals for food, clothing and tools. There were no restrictions on bison hunting, and a skilled hunter could kill 250 of the animals in a day. One person from Kansas managed to shoot 120 bison in just 40 minutes. The animals’ tongues and hides were prized, and sent back to factories in the east to make leather.  Jim Stone works for the Inter Tribal Buffalo Council. The group is made up of 58 Native American tribes in 19 states. It works to re-establish buffalo herds on American Indian lands. He says, “There was no way for us to sustain ourselves when the buffalo were exterminated, so we handed over vast tracts of land." Stone says, “Our relationship with buffalo has been there since time immemorial." He says the Native American creation stories feature buffalo. Many tribes modeled their family structures on the animals, viewing them as family-orientated, healthy creatures. That connection was broken by the arrival of European settlers, and Stone’s tribe, the Yankton-Sioux, was unable to raise a bison for more than a century after that. He says, “It’s not a good story. Our social structure was destroyed. When we bring the buffalo back, we’ll bring the people back because we’ll relearn how to structure our lives.”  Things started to get better for the bison in the 1900s. Scientist John Muir, future president Theodore Roosevelt and William Hornaday drew attention to the bison. Hornaday was the first director of the Bronx Zoo. The American Bison Society was then formed, possibly the first attempt at recovering a species. Bison were mated at the Bronx Zoo and transported into newly protected areas. A herd of 24 bison in Yellowstone National Park was supplemented with others. Now the group numbers more than 5,000.  Keith Aune works at the Wildlife Conservation Society, a group that helps to protect wild places around the world. Aune says, “People started to speak out, to say it wasn’t good for the country to kill off the bison.” He says, “Around 1900, people started to think differently about nature and they got active on the political stage." Thirty years later, the American Bison Society closed down. The group thought its work was done.  The initial effort protected wild buffalo and created a network of national parks. The animals' numbers grew and then evened out. There are now 30,000 that roam free, including on tribal land, and 400,000 more that are raised on ranches. The buffalo were thought about less as the conservation movement grew. People focused on other kinds of animals. However, the American Bison Society is now re-established and fighting to get more attention for the buffalo. The national mammal designation will help that effort, but offers no new protections.  Aune points out that there are only eight bison herds that are not fenced in. He worries that if they are too isolated, the animals will lose the ability to adapt and survive. He says, “These animals can deal with climate change and their grazing has benefits to the ecosystem for birds, prairie dogs and other creatures. They are also healthy to eat. Our hope is that the profile will be increased and people won’t forget the bison again.”
