SeaWorld in debate on whales' fate SAN DIEGO, Calif. â€” SeaWorld will end orca shows in San Diego. Visitors would like to see the orcas act naturally rather than do tricks. Animal rights activists were happy about SeaWorld's decision. However, they said the marine park should not keep orcas at all. Orcas are also called killer whales. Joel Manby is the head of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. He said the park in San Diego, California, will have a different kind of orca experience. It will start in 2017. It will show how the whales live and behave in the ocean. Representative Adam Schiff of California said that ending the orca shows is a good first step. However, he thinks the plan does not go far enough. He wants a law that would keep orcas from giving birth to baby whales in tanks. Schiff said that orcas do not do well in tanks. As long as SeaWorld has orcas at all, these problems will continue, Schiff said. Orcas are used to swimming in big areas. Confining them in tanks can change their behavior. Also, some have broken teeth from biting on metal gates. SeaWorld is based in Orlando, Florida. The company is not doing as well as it used to. It has not made as much money since a 2013 movie came out. The movie is called "Blackfish." It looks at how orcas react to being confined. It also described the case of Tilikum. The killer whale caused the death of a trainer in 2010 by pulling her into a pool at SeaWorld Orlando. Also, fewer people are visiting the SeaWorld parks. The San Diego park has seen the biggest drop. Orcas shows will be stopped only in San Diego. They will continue at the other two SeaWorld parks in Orlando and San Antonio, Texas. After the trainer died, other trainers stopped going into the water during shows. They still swim with the killer whales while training them. Manby said that the new show will send a strong message about saving whales. California visitors want to see how the whales act in the ocean, he said. They want to see fewer tricks. Visitors at the other two parks may not feel the same way, he said. SeaWorld has plans to spend $100 million to enlarge the killer whale tanks in San Diego. It hopes this will bring in more visitors. The project is called Blue World. The California Coastal Commission is a state department in charge of the coast. It said it will approve SeaWorld's project on several conditions. SeaWorld cannot breed, move or sell any of its orcas in the park, the commission said. SeaWorld does not agree. It said the conditions would have a bad effect on all zoos and aquariums. Seaworld plans to ask a judge to let the project continue.
