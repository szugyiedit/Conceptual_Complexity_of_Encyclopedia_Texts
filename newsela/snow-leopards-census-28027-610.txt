Researchers in Russia are using hidden cameras to take a population count of the number of snow leopards roaming in the wild. The snow leopard is a mysterious animal. It is also hard to find. Some people call it the “ghost of the mountains.” Today, scientists are coming face to face with the animal more than ever before. They are using camera traps. They don't actually trap the animals, though. The camera traps are hidden cameras that take pictures of snow leopards. The animals do not know they are there. Many of the camera traps are in Russia. The cameras are placed in a park high in the mountains where snow leopards live. These mountains stretch across several countries, not just Russia. When a leopard walks by, the camera takes a picture. Often, the leopards are looking for food. Scientists used to learn about snow leopards from paw prints. They would search an area for any signs of the animals. Then, they could guess how many lived there. Now, they have pictures. This makes it much easier for scientists to study snow leopards. They look at the spots on the animals' fur. This helps them figure out who is who. They will have a much better idea of how many snow leopards there really are.  No one knows how many snow leopards are in Russia. Some people think there are fewer than 70\.  Scientists are trying to find out how many snow leopards live in the area. The cameras have been in Russia for seven years. Today, there are more than 180 of them. There will be 50 more cameras by the end of the year. For some people in Russia, the snow leopard is a sacred animal. Others have killed the animals to sell their fur. Also, the leopards are killed in traps by mistake. These traps are set up for hunting other animals. The leopards step in them instead. Changes in the climate may also hurt snow leopards. More snow could prevent smaller animals from grazing. If the smaller animals die, snow leopards would lose their source of food. The leopards could die from hunger.
