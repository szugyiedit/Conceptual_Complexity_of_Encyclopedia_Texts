Many scientists now believe language itself might go back millions of years. A new study says chimpanzees can learn language. In 2010, a group of chimpanzees was taken from a zoo in the Netherlands. They were put together with chimps at a Scotland zoo. Scientists watched what happened next. At first, each group stayed apart. Each group used its own sound when they saw an apple. Three years passed. The two groups started using the same sound for apple. The first group learned from the second group. Scientists used to think only people learned language. Now, they think chimps can do it too. The discovery says something else important. Language may be older than scientists thought. It might go back millions of years. Scientists know that apes use different calls for things or events. Chimpanzees make one sound for an attacker. They make another sound for food. Other chimps can understand those calls. Scientists did not think this was real language, said Simon Townsend. He helped write the study. Townsend teaches at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. Scientists thought these calls and grunts were just noises. It was the way chimps share information. Most scientists thought that apes were born knowing these calls. They could not learn new calls. With humans, speech changes over time. It can be taught. "There is no difference, at least in chimpanzees,‚Äù Townsend said. In the study, scientists recorded the grunts each group made for food. For the first two years, not much changed. The chimps slowly got to know one another. By 2013, the sound the Netherlands chimps made for apples changed. It sounded more like the Scottish chimps. By then, the chimps were hanging out together. Scientists do not know the reason why the sound changed. The chimps may want to be better understood, Townsend said. The chimps may also just be trying to make friends, he said. Charles Snowdon does not agree. He is a scientist at the University of Wisconsin. He said the chimpanzees did not really learn a new sound. Snowdon pointed out that the chimps took time to warm up. The new calls were about becoming part of a group, he said. It was not about language.
