The people do not like that SeaWorld puts killer whales in tanks. SAN DIEGO, Calif. — SeaWorld San Diego has many sea animals. Sea animals normally live in the ocean. But people can go to SeaWorld to see them in tanks. Some people are mad at SeaWorld. They say SeaWorld treats orcas badly. Orcas are also called killer whales. SeaWorld San Diego has 10 orcas. "Blackfish" is a movie about SeaWorld. It showed SeaWorld's killer whales are not treated well. Now SeaWorld San Diego says that will change. They will try to make the orcas' lives better. They will make a bigger pool for the orcas. The new pool will be very big. It will be as big as two of the orcas' pools now. Visitors will also see the orcas underwater. Jim Atchison is SeaWorld's president. He said the new pool will be very different. It will change "how visitors experience killer whales," he said. Atchison said visitors will see orcas in different ways. They can "walk alongside the whales." Or they can watch the whales swim underwater. People can even see them from above. SeaWorld will also study orcas in the ocean. It will have a team of scientists. The scientists will watch over SeaWorld's orcas. They will see if the orcas are happy. But PETA is unhappy. PETA a group that wants to protect animals. It makes sure people treat animals well. It does not like the new plans for the orcas. It wants the orcas to be put in the ocean. PETA says orcas don't like any pools. They call it a prison. “A bigger prison is still a prison,” said PETA. Millions of people go to SeaWorld each year. That's more people than the whole city of San Diego. Most people see the orca show. But SeaWorld says fewer people now want to see the orcas.
