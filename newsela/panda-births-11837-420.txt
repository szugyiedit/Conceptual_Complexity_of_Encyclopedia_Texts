Zoo surprised by twin pandas Mei Xiang is a giant panda. She lives in the National Zoo in Washington. On Saturday, she gave birth to twins. Her cubs were the size of large mice. Their eyes were not open. Their ears looked like small bumps. They had fine white fur and claws. The vets could not tell if they were boys or girls. The first cub was born at 5:35 p.m. The second cub arrived at 10:07 p.m. Zookeepers put the younger cub in an incubator. The container kept it warm. The cub was checked. It was fed and returned to its mother. Then keepers took the older cub out. Both cubs squealed loudly. Their squealing means they are healthy. A squealing baby panda makes everyone happy, the head veterinarian said. Zookeepers watched to see if Mei could care for both babies. Pandas often give birth to twins. Sometimes they even have triplets. Usually, only one baby lives. Mei could not take care of both cubs. The keepers took one of the cubs away. They wrapped it in a towel. Then they put the cub in a warm incubator. Laurie Thompson works for the zoo. She put her hand over the cub. Cubs like to feel snug. They are just like human babies, she said. Dr. Copper Aitken-Palmer is a vet at the zoo. She called a panda center in China. Pandas come from China. She asked questions about caring for cubs. She also wanted to share the good news. Sadly, later in the week one cub died. Mei already gave birth to two cubs that lived. Tai Shan is a boy. He was born in 2005. He lives in China. Bao Bao is a girl. She turned 2 at the zoo on Sunday.
