Reviled birds reduce rat population JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Allyn Bagu lives in South Africa. One day she learned there were birds living in her roof. They were owls. She thought about moving. She thought owls were bad luck. Many people in South Africa think owls are bad luck. EcoSolutions came to help. It is a group that moves owls. EcoSolutions went to Allyn's roof. There were 10 owls there. EcoSolutions caught two baby owls. The grown-up owls flew away. The owls needed a new home to go to. Boxes were set up for the owls to build nests. The people who work for EcoSolutions want people to know the truth about owls. They do not want people to be afraid of them. They started the Township Owls Project to teach people about owls. Children learn how to take care of the owls. The hope is that the children will help protect the owls. Lerato Ramathopa took care of owls when she was 13. Lerato fed the owlets. She cleaned their box. She held them. It changed her life. "I started developing a love for owls," Lerato said. Hussein Mduduzi is an owl catcher. He grew up in a small town. At bedtime he heard the hoots of owls. He was afraid. Hussein began rescuing owls five years ago. He was nervous. He did not trust owls. Now after years of saving owlets, he has learned to love them. Hussein teaches people that owls are like any other birds. They also catch large rats. South Africa has many large rats. The rats crawl into people’s homes. They eat their food, clothing and shoes. The owls help keep people safe. Most people are learning to live with the owls around them. “Now they know that owls are not dangerous to people," Hussein said.
