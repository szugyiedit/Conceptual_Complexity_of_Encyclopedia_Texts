SeaWorld in debate on whales' fate SAN DIEGO, Calif. â€” Animal rights activists applauded SeaWorld's plans to end its orca shows in San Diego. However, they said the marine park should stop keeping killer whales in captivity altogether. SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. made the announcement Monday about ending the shows. Visitors at the San Diego park made it clear they prefer seeing killer whales act naturally rather than doing tricks. The famous "Shamu" show began at the San Diego park many years ago. It featured killer whales doing flips and other stunts. SeaWorld head Joel Manby said the park will offer a different kind of orca experience, starting in 2017. It will focus on the whales' natural environment and how they behave in the wild. Representative Adam Schiff of California plans to introduce a law to end breeding orcas in captivity. He said ending the shows is a good first step but doesn't go far enough. He said that as long as SeaWorld holds orcas in captivity, the problems caused by confining the whales will persist. Whales held in aquariums may suffer from stress and have broken teeth from biting on metal gates. SeaWorld is based in Orlando, Florida. Its income has dropped since the 2013 release of the film "Blackfish." The film examined how orcas respond to being confined. The movie told of the case of Tilikum. That killer whale caused the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 by pulling her into a pool at SeaWorld Orlando. Park attendance is down the most at the San Diego location. Orca shows will be stopped only there. They will continue at the other two SeaWorld parks in Orlando and San Antonio, Texas. The killer whale shows at the Shamu stadium in San Diego were the park's main attraction in the 1970s and helped make SeaWorld a top tourist spot. Trainers would ride the whales in the giant pool. Then they would get out and signal for the orcas to slap their tails in the water to splash visitors. After Brancheau's death, trainers stopped going into the water during the shows. They continued to swim with the killer whales while training them. Manby said Monday that California customers want to see more natural shows and fewer tricks. The new attraction will send a strong message about saving whales. "They want the orca experience to be activities the whales do in the wild," Manby said. "Things they perceive as tricks, they don't like as well." Visitors at the other two parks don't necessarily feel that way, he said. On Sunday, SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. reported that it made less money than expected in the third quarter of the year. SeaWorld earlier this year announced that it will spend $100 million to expand the killer whale tanks in San Diego. The purpose is to attract more visitors. The project is called Blue World. But the California Coastal Commission said it would approve the project only if SeaWorld agreed not to breed, transfer or sell any of its captive orcas at the park. SeaWorld plans to fight the commission's decision in court. Manby said it would have a bad effect not only on SeaWorld, but on all zoos and aquariums, and suggested that the company might cancel its Blue World project. He said the company would be foolish if it didn't look at other options. He announced that the company might add hotels at its parks, starting with San Diego, to attract overnight visitors. SeaWorld has reached an agreement with a hotel construction company to begin exploring the possibility.
