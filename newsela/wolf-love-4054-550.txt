The lone wolf left his pack behind and has spent three years wandering between Oregon and California. Scientists say he has finally settled down with a mate. Three years ago, a gray wolf left his wolf pack in northeastern Oregon. He walked from Oregon to California. He was looking for a partner and a new place to live. The wolf wandered thousands of miles between the two states. He became famous. Filmmakers made a documentary movie about him. Now, the wolf has probably found love. He may even be a dad. The wolf traveled to California’s Siskiyou County. He was the first gray wolf seen in California since 1924. Scientists followed him with a tracking collar. The wolf traveled about 3,000 miles after leaving his pack. Then, he started to act differently. He seemed to be settling in one area of Oregon. Scientists wanted to know why he stopped traveling. They put some cameras out in the forest in April. The cameras took photos of another wolf. That wolf was black. The black wolf squatted to pee. It had a narrow face and a narrow space between its ears. That meant the black wolf was a girl. But was she the gray wolf's girlfriend? A few weeks later, the cameras got a picture of the gray wolf walking in the forest. An hour later, the cameras took a picture of the black wolf running past the same spot. Scientists now knew they live in the same place. “They certainly know about each other ... It’s very likely they’ve paired up," said John Stephenson, a scientist. Gray wolves usually mate in late January and early February. Pups are born in April. Forty years ago, lawmakers warned [the gray wolf was in danger of dying out](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Since then, they have been protecting wolves. Now, the wolves are coming back.
