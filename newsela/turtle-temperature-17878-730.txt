Turtle study ties warmth to gender Back in the 1980s, scientists tried to save a few sea turtles. The scientists rescued turtle eggs from crowded, busy beaches. They kept the eggs warm in incubators until the turtles hatched. The plan was to return them to the sea. <img class="pull-right" src="https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/turtles.jpg"/> When the sea turtles were born, the scientists noticed something truly strange. Almost every single one of them was a boy.  How could taking the turtle eggs out of the sand have made that happen? It seemed crazy to the scientists. Yet, here were dozens of boy sea turtles wriggling in front of them.  It turns out that turtles are unusual. For most animals, chromosomes decide whether a baby is born a boy or a girl. Chromosomes are passed down from parent to child. They contain the genes that make us develop one way or another.  With turtles, something else makes an unborn turtle develop into a boy or girl. The temperature outside the egg is what makes the difference.  Warmer temperatures make it more likely a turtle will become a girl. Cooler temperatures make it likely a turtle will become a boy.  A difference of a few degrees is all it takes to go one way or the other. Scientists are still trying to understand how and why that happens.  Scientist Turk Rhen may have found the answer. He says he has found the gene that is responsible. For the most part, turtles become boys or girls in the same way as other animals. Genes do most of the work. As different types of genes get turned on, boy or girl parts begin to grow. Eventually, a baby boy or girl is formed. However, these genes do not react to the temperature. Rhen wanted to know what was setting them off.  Somewhere in a turtle's body, a gene must be checking the temperature outside the egg. Then, it must be telling the other genes what to do. Rhen thinks that special gene is something called the CIRBP gene. It is known to help set body temperature in many animals. Rhen decided to run an experiment to find out if he was right.  Rhen put a group of turtle eggs in incubators. Then, he changed their surrounding temperatures. Next, he examined the turtles to see how they their bodies reacted to the change. Rhen found that the CIRBP genes turned on as soon as the temperature changed. Within two days, the genes that make turtles boys or girls sprang into action. Rhen thinks the CIRBP gene was directing all the other genes. He also thinks he knows why turtles became the way they are. Boy or man turtles are called male. Girl or woman turtles are called female. In the wild, larger male turtles usually do better than smaller ones. They are better at fighting off enemies.  Turtles in eggs usually grow faster when temperatures are colder. Turtles that grow faster usually end up larger.  Over time, these facts shaped the way turtles developed.  Male turtles born at lower temperatures are usually larger. Because they are larger they are more likely to live longer and have more children. They then pass down their genes to their offspring.  Some of those genes favor colder temperatures. Soon, those genes become much more common. If temperatures are warmer while turtles are developing, their bodies usually turn out smaller. A smaller body is not a problem for female turtles. So when temperatures get warmer and there are more female turtles, it is not a problem.  All this eventually led to the special way turtles become male or female. It may seem strange, but it also makes perfect sense.
