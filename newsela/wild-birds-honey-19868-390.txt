Honey Money WASHINGTON, D.C. — There are some wild birds in Africa that help people find honey in trees. When people hunt for honey, they make a "brrr-hm" sound. Birds called honeyguides hear the sound. They get noisy. They fly from tree to tree. They stop when they find a bees' nest. The bees' nests are hidden. People follow the birds to get to the honey. One scientist tried to make the "brrr-hm" sound. She wanted to see if it worked. She learned that it did. Her name is Claire Spottiswoode. Her friend helped her. She found nests when her friend made the right noise. The honey was "very flavorful," she said. The honeyguides are good at finding bees' nests. Scientists are not sure why. They think it is because the birds can smell very well. There is a problem. The nests are stuck in trees. They are hidden. The birds cannot always reach them. The bees sting the honeyguides and sometimes kill them. The people who live near the bees are called the Yao. They sell the honey to make money. They use axes to reach the nests. Axes are long, sharp tools. The Yao use smoke to chase away the bees. They try to stop the bees from stinging the birds. It is hard for people to see the bees hiding in trees. The honeyguides are a big help. The Yao people take the honey. The birds eat the wax. The honeyguides help the hunters and have a pretty name. But they can be mean. The honeyguides put their eggs in the nests of other birds. When the honeyguide comes out of its shell, it has a beak with a hook at the end. It uses it to kill the other birds in the nest.
