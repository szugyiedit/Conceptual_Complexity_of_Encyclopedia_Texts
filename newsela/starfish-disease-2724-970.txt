The death toll has been estimated from the tens of thousands to the low millions. Scientists aren't sure what caused the disease. In some cases, the starfish lose their arms. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140205_STARFISH.jpg" />ANCHORAGE, Alaska — At the Anchorage Museum, starfish cling to rocks and wait to be lifted out of the tank for petting. These silent, slow five-armed creatures don't seem likely to suffer sudden drama. But last fall, the museum’s starfish started getting a disease that is killing the animals up and down the West Coast. The disease is called sea star wasting syndrome. Its symptoms include unnatural twisting of the arms and white marks on the starfish’s body. A speedy death often comes after the starfish loses its arms and the animal's body softens. The disease has killed huge numbers of starfish. Experts are worried. They haven't yet found a cause for the plague. The population of starfish on the West Coast is estimated to be in the tens of millions. Scientists don’t know how many have died from the disease. But Pete Raimondi, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said it could range from tens of thousands to the low millions. Similar die-offs have occurred before, but an event of this size has never been documented. The syndrome has been reported as far south as San Diego, nearly 2,500 miles from Anchorage. In Alaska, evidence of the disease was first observed last summer on remote Kayak Island. Raimondi was there, working with the Sitka Sound Science Center to conduct surveys on sea life living on the coast. A number of diseased sea stars were discovered on the island in the cold Gulf of Alaska. This disproved an earlier theory that the starfish illness was linked to warmer water. “It was the last place on earth where we would have expected to see it,” Professor Raimondi explained. The researchers took pictures and left. And at that point, the illness started showing up all over the West Coast. On a recent morning, Anchorage Museum curator Greg Danner walked into a room where sick animals are isolated for treatment and care. Nicole Abeln, an animal care technician, pulled out a folder called “Sea Star Wasting Disease Information and Logbook.” She opened it up. One entry from a trip to Whittier on Aug. 25 reports that they found "one sea star twisted and looking deflated." That sea star was so ill that the scientists eventually killed the animal to end its suffering. The museum put to death a total of eight suffering sea stars between August and November. Symptoms ranged from white patches on their arms to a sea star that lost two arms during the day. The staff had never seen anything like it. But since November, the disease seems to have vanished again, Danner said. He said that changes the museum made — such as controlling tank temperature by limiting the number of hands in the water — may have made a difference, but it’s hard to tell. “We’re in the same mystery boat as the rest of the world,” Danner said. Raimondi said the symptoms are more present in starfishes kept in aquariums and zoos. This could be a sign that stress in the animals shows more quickly outside their natural environment, the scientist said. He also said that the term “wasting” describes the symptoms. These symptoms are actually seen all the time, he said, and are put down to stress, such as a starfish drying out or getting sick. But Raimondi explained that the sea stars are still getting the disease in the wild and in places where they belong. These are not unlucky animals that have been washed up on a beach, but starfish in their normal environment. The science so far seems to show that starfish species are affected differently depending on their physical location. For species in tide pool areas, the sores show up first and are followed by tissue decay, Raimondi said. Death might follow in a matter of weeks, or even not at all. But in underwater sea star species the sickness is much quicker and more deadly. When starfishes under the surface get the disease, tissue decay happens in hours or a day rather than weeks. Raimondi said scientists are close to identifying the cause of the syndrome. An infection appears to be the most likely to blame, he said. There does not appear to be a link between the disease and radiation that leaked from the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011, as some experts suggested. Yet, if a cause of the disease is found, another uncertainty and a problem for the future remains: How do we stop it? “Is it the type of thing that will heal itself over time? That’s the real question,” Raimondi said.
