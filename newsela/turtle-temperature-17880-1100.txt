Turtle study ties warmth to gender In the 1980s, scientists trying to save sea turtles noticed something truly strange. They thought they were doing something good: rescuing eggs from crowded, busy beaches and keeping them warm in incubators until they were ready to swim out to sea. <img class="pull-right" src="https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/turtles.jpg"/> When the sea turtles were born, however, almost every single one of them was male. At that point, scientists had long known that sex was determined by a creature's chromosomes. It seemed crazy that you could change a hatchling's sex just by taking its egg out of the sand. Yet, here were dozens of all-male sea turtles wriggling in front of them. What those scientists encountered was temperature-dependent sex determination, a phenomenon found in a range of cold-blooded animals. Unlike mammals or birds, whose sex is set by the chromosomes they get from their parents, the trigger that causes unborn turtles to develop into baby boys or girls comes from outside the egg. Warmer temperatures during incubation will make the hatchlings likely to turn out female. Keep the eggs just a few degrees cooler — as the scientists in the 1980s unintentionally did — and they will come out mostly male. Three decades later, scientists are still trying to understand exactly how and why that happens. From an evolutionary standpoint, it seems pretty risky — it would take only a few hot years full of female hatchlings to spell the end of the entire species. From a developmental standpoint, it is just as confusing. If an unborn turtle's chromosomes are not telling it what way to grow, what is? Biologist Turk Rhen may have found an answer to at least one of those questions. In a study published this week, he identifies a gene that seems to be responsible for turning hot and cold temperatures into girl and boy babies. If he is right, the find could help keep turtles safe in an ever-warming world. For decades, there has already been research into the sex differentiation of turtles. Even though the trigger for sexual differentiation is not genetic, scientists know that the developmental process that leads to either a male or female turtle is more or less the same as in other species: It is carried out by genes.  Early in development, some of the same genes that control sex in humans are also put to work in turtles. As each gets switched on, they cause blobs of tissue to develop into male or female reproductive parts. In turn, this sets off a cascade of reactions that eventually produces a baby boy or girl. However, while those genes might control sex, they do not respond to temperature. Rhen wanted to know how the whole process starts. Somewhere in the body, a "thermometer gene" must be telling the other genes what to do. Rhen first identified a likely candidate several years ago: the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein gene, or CIRBP for short. It is known to be involved in body heat regulation in humans and other mammals. In his newest study, Rhen checked to see if CIRBP was being turned on at the right time to be responsible for taking the temperature and directing the body's response. Turtle eggs in incubators had their surrounding temperatures changed by less than 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The change was made during a five-day window of development when sexual differentiation is known to take place. Then the turtles' tissue was examined to see how the turtles responded. The reaction was almost immediate. Within two days, the genes involved in sex differentiation started to spring into action. Not only that, Rhen found that a minute variation in the gene changes how turtles respond to temperature. One version lowers the temperature threshold for females — which are typically born at the warmest incubation temperatures. The other version raises it. Rhen now suspects that CIRBP is involved in regulating all the other genes that determine sex. He also has a theory to explain why turtles evolved this way in the first place.  In 1995, he and a fellow scientist used hormones to get female turtles to hatch at "male" temperatures. They found that the females grew far larger than they normally would be. Paired with the knowledge that larger male turtles are usually more successful, since they can fight off competition, a picture began to take shape: Natural selection favored male turtles born at lower temperatures, because those temperatures speed up development and result in larger bodies. Those successful males then passed down their low-temperature-favoring genes. Over time, the current developmental pattern took shape. All this worked just fine until the planet's temperatures began rising dramatically, due to human-caused global warming. A recent report on loggerhead sea turtles in Florida found that the vast majority of nests studied produced between 90 and 100 percent female hatchlings four years in a row. Researchers studying painted turtles in Mississippi estimate that an average temperature increase of just 1.1 degrees Celsius would be enough to skew the population to all female. In time, the shortage of males would lead to species extinction. Understanding how sex differentiation works in turtles will become more and more important as Earth warms. Knowing that some turtles have, say, the gene variant that raises the temperature threshold to skew female might help scientists to save them. The big question, said scientist Kelsey Metzger, who coauthored the CIRBP study, is whether turtles have enough "genetic variation" to be able to adapt to rising temperatures.
