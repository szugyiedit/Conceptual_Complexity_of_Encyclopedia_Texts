Evidence shows humans used to hunt giant sloths. Each year 500,000 people visit New Mexico's White Sands National Monument. The park is famous for its white dunes made of gypsum, a soft white mineral that resembles sand. Aside from the tourists, few animals in the region get much larger than a coyote or bobcat. It was different 2 1/2 million years ago, however. That's when the Pleistocene period started, a time in earth's history that ended about 12,000 years ago. Mammoths and mastodons (which looked like mammoths) walked the desert. So did saber-tooth cats, North American camels and huge, 8,000-pound sloths. Ancient humans followed these creatures. We know this because the travelers left footprints — physical evidence that people chased the giants. In a western corner of White Sands, scientists recently found a human print inside a ground sloth's paw marks. Human Tracks Followed Animal Tracks - "Thousands and thousands of trackways" crisscross the area, said Vince Santucci, a senior paleontologist with the National Park Service. The official term for such concentrated pathways is a megatrack. The megatrack in White Sands "is the largest one that we know of in North America." In 2011, researchers began a thorough survey of the megatrack at the nearby White Sands Missile Range. This survey revealed the first collection of human tracks, 27 individual footprints that vanished into a dune. Santucci and other researchers measured the stride and the gait to predict where beneath the dune the next print should be. Then they excavated the dune." And lo and behold, right where we anticipated they would have been, were human footprints," he said. Preservation Of Tracks Is Difficult - The tracks at the White Sands flats are remote and bordered by the military testing range to the north. The ancient walkers' prints were found in former lake beds. Over time, they were covered by a half-inch layer of sand. The tracks, if exposed to moisture, will crumble shortly after excavation. "The preservation of the footprints is not the best," said Andrew R.C. Milner, a paleontologist at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site museum in Utah. Milner was not a part of this research team but had observed some of the animal tracks at White Sands. "We can definitely see large animals," he said, including the kidney-bean shaped marks of sloth paws. Humans drove North American ground sloths to extinction around 11,000 years ago. Yet National Park Service paleontologists struggled to determine the age of the human prints. They used a method called carbon dating. It looks at how the element carbon breaks down over time, to figure out how old something is. "The dates are coming up all over the place," Santucci said. In 2016, they invited experts from around the world to help examine the tracks. Matthew Bennett, a paleontologist in Britain, accepted the invitation. The bipedal prints were unmistakably human, he said, with "really good toes, heels and arches." A Human Print Within A Sloth Print Bennett, however, decided to focus on the sloth tracks, and when he was excavating a sloth trackway, he found something odd. Two prints, a human's and a sloth's squished together.  Milner said the discovery of the human-within-sloth prints was remarkable. It suggests that the minimum age of the prints is at least 11,000 years old, as ancient as the last ground sloth. This means a human followed quite literally in the sloth's footsteps. Matteo Belvedere is a Swiss scientist who specializes in trackways. "Given the \[dry\] environment," he said, "there is quite a narrow amount of time you can walk on that surface to record your footprint."  It was not possible to narrow down the time scale to hours or minutes, he said. Still, the human probably followed the sloth within a day. This evidence of an interaction, or exchange, between human and extinct giant sloth is "unique in the world," Belvedere said. But How Did The Chase End? The tracks led the scientists to a site that suggests confrontation. There, marks in the sand show the sloth turned to face approaching humans. Some scientists, however, like Santucci and Milner, do not think the encounter had a violent end.  Bennett and Belvedere think that humans were readying for a kill. Given the position of the claw and knuckle marks, the sloth may have reared up to unleash "the equivalent of a 'Go away!' roar," Bennett said. Another line of toe prints suggests a second person approached the sloth at an angle. Perhaps that person was a hunter about to deliver a surprise deadly blow, Bennett said. This scene might lean toward wishful thinking, he admitted. "With a lot of time and money you can follow the sloth tracks as long as possible," Belvedere said. That scientist would eventually find where the animal either escaped or collapsed from a spear. So this encounter will have its conclusion written in the sand.
