Manatees in Belize face increasing threats from development. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) works to save animals. Manatees were in danger. It looked like soon there would be none left. Manatees would be extinct. After years of hard work, the FWS said the Florida manatees are doing better. They are not perfectly safe, but they should survive. Manatees living near Belize are in more danger. Jamal Galvez is a scientist in Belize. It is near Mexico. He says the FWS is wrong. The FWS has taken the manatee off a list. The list has all of the most endangered animals on it. He said what the FWS did will hurt manatees in Belize. In Belize, places where manatees swim have changed. Belize is changing the land near its coast. It wants more people to visit. Galvez says seagrass has been dug out. Trees were torn down. Ports for cruise ship have been built. People on vacation have hurt manatees.   At least 40 manatees were killed in 2015\. Some were killed by speed boats. Others were caught in large fishing nets. Belize has almost 1,000 manatees. Galvez says they must be kept safe. Sadly, the FWS news makes people think the job is done. “People are calling me and saying ‘Jamal, you did it, you did it," he says.  Galvez is worried. Florida is not Belize. Thinking manatees are not in danger could make them extinct. Belize has old laws to help manatees. Galvez says they need new laws. The U.S. laws have helped the Florida manatee. They were an example for Belize. People in Belize must try even harder to save their manatees. The next few years are very important. Galvez says more baby manatees need to be born. No more ports should be built. Waters around Belize need to be safe. Galvez says more has to be done.
