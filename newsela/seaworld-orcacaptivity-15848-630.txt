SeaWorld to stop breeding orcas MIAMI, Fla. — SeaWorld recently made an announcement about its orcas. They are also known as killer whales. SeaWorld said it will not breed or raise baby orcas anymore.  SeaWorld also said it will work with the Humane Society of the United States. It is called the HSUS for short. The HSUS is a group that protects animals. SeaWorld said it will end the orca shows at its parks. There will be new ways for people to see orcas. The new shows will begin next year. They will start at SeaWorld's San Diego, California, park. In three years, the new shows will come to the other parks. They are in San Antonio, Texas, and Orlando, Florida. The change at SeaWorld comes after some bad events. In 2010, an orca killed a trainer. Then in 2013, the movie "Blackfish" came out. The movie told the story of the trainer's death. Recently, SeaWorld has had fewer visitors and is losing a lot of money.  Joel Manby is the president at SeaWorld. He said that SeaWorld has taught many people about orcas through its shows. "We are proud of our part in contributing to the human understanding of these animals." He said SeaWorld is changing the way people will meet "these beautiful animals."  SeaWorld also said that working with HSUS will help teach people about animals. They are working together to start new programs at the parks. Wayne Pacelle is the president of HSUS. He said that for many animal protection groups, SeaWorld's announcement is a win. They have wanted it for a long time. He is proud of SeaWorld for making this change. PETA is another group that tries to protect animals. Colleen O'Brien works for PETA. "SeaWorld must open its tanks to the oceans," she said. Letting the orcas go is the way to give them a better life, she suggested. SeaWorld said in 2014 that it would build new, larger homes for its orcas. Adam Schiff is a lawmaker in California. He introduced a bill to protect orcas in 2015\. Schiff applauded SeaWorld's announcement on Thursday. Schiff said that many animal welfare groups have wanted this for a long time. He thinks that SeaWorld will have more visitors if the orcas are treated better.
