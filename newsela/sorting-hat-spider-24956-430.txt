Spider named for Rowling character Some scientists found a new kind of spider.   Two of the scientists are Javed Ahmed and Rajashree Khalap. They like books about Harry Potter. They thought the spider looked like a certain hat. The hat is in a Harry Potter book.  The hat is called the Sorting Hat. It was part of the story at Harry Potter's school. Godric Gryffindor owned the hat.  The scientists got to name the spider because they found it. So they named the spider after the hat. They named it Eriovixia gryffindori. It is tiny and brown. Ahmed and Khalap liked reading Harry Potter books. J.K. Rowling wrote the books.  They thought Harry Potter's made-up world was like the real world. They wanted to find new things in the world. This feeling sent them to part of India. India is a country in Asia. Many kinds of animals and plants live in India. They found the spider there.   Ahmed and Khalap found the spider with another scientist. The scientists caught the spider. Soon they knew they had found a new kind of spider.   The E. gryffindori spider is tiny. Its shape lets the spider hide in the plants in India's mountains. The mountains are home to many different kinds of animals. Some people say it is an important place to protect.  The Sorting Hat is from the Hogwarts School. Harry Potter and his friends were there most of the time. The hat is placed on the head of each new student. It is a magic hat. Ahmed said he thought the Harry Potter name would make people care about spiders. Khalap liked the name. So did Rowling. She wrote to them on the computer. She said she was happy that they found the spider. Ahmed said he has an idea for another name. It is from the Harry Potter books, too. The name is Aragog. It is a big, hairy spider that talks. They might name another spider after Aragog, he said.
