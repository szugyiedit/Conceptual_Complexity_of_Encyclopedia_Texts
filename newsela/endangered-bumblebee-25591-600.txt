Species of bee declared endangered in U.S. TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. — The rusty patched bumblebee is officially endangered. Endangered means a plant or animal is dying out. It is in danger of becoming extinct. If an animal is extinct, there are no members of the species left. This type of bumblebee has been dying off for 20 years. Many buzzed across the United States in the 1990s. Today, only small numbers remain.  The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is a government agency. It said the bee is endangered. It added the bee to a list of plants and animals that may die out. The list is part of the Endangered Species Act. This is a big environmental law. It was created to protect endangered animals and plants. The agency has a plan to rescue the bee. It wants people to plant more gardens where the bee can live and fly. It also wants people to stop using pesticides. Pesticides are chemicals that kill bugs. They can harm bees. The bumblebee is important because it is a pollinator. Pollinators move pollen from one plant to another. This helps plants grow. It helps them produce fruits and vegetables. Our food system depends on pollinators.  Scientists are now studying why the bee is dying. It might be because of disease or pesticides. It could also be because the bee does not have enough places to live.  Environmental groups are worried about the bee. They asked the government to put the bee on the endangered list. They hope that protecting it will help other pollinators, too. There are 48 kinds of bees in North America.  Rebecca Riley works for the Natural Resources Defense Council. It is a group that tries to protect wildlife. She is happy that the bee was added to the endangered list. She said that is the bee's best hope for staying alive.
