T. rex had the toughest teeth Tyrannosaurus rex was a huge dinosaur. A T. rex could even eat other dinosaurs. It could chew right through bones.  A team of researchers studied T. rex teeth. They wanted to know how the T. rex crushed bones.  The T. rex did not just break bones. It could chew and swallow them. Smaller, weaker dinosaurs could not eat bones the same way.  Paul Gignac was the lead writer of the study. He said that the T. rex was different from other dinosaurs. The T. rex had a stronger bite force. This meant it could bite down harder than any other animal. The researchers wanted to learn more about T. rex bite force. They compared the T. rex to wolves. Wolves are a predator that can be studied more easily. Unlike the T. rex, wolves are still around today.  Wolves are able to crush the bones of their prey. Their bite is not as strong as a T. rex bite, though. The secret? Researchers learned that it is something special about the wolves' teeth.  Wolves have sharp teeth that fit together perfectly. The top and bottom teeth lock together. This trait is common in animals that eat meat.  The T. rex did not have that type of teeth. Still, it could break large bones. Researchers found out that T. rex were so strong their teeth did not need to fit together. T. rex had teeth that were strong and sturdy. They were huge and shaped like cones. The teeth could tear into any animal. When the teeth wore down, they were replaced by new teeth.  The T. rex was strong enough to bite very hard. However, its teeth could only handle so much. The bite of a T. rex was very powerful. It is amazing that its teeth did not break.  The bite of a T. rex had to be just the right strength. It was strong enough to crack bones. If a T. rex bite was too strong, it could hurt the dinosaur's teeth.
