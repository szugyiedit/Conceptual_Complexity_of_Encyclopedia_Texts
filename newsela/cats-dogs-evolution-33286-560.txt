Cat vs. dog loyalties and domestication likely began thousands of years ago Do you like cats or dogs?  People are often asked to pick their favorite.  But, cats and dogs might not be as different as people thought. Cats and dogs share a family member. This family member is from a very long time ago. These are called ancestors. People have ancestors, too. Cats and dogs belong to the same group of animals. Their group is called Carnivora. Animals in this group are called carnivorans.  Bears and skunks are in this group, too. So are some sea animals. Seals, walruses and sea lions are sea animals.  Carnivorans' ancestors are from a group of animals called miacids. These were small animals with long bodies. They lived in trees. Miacids appeared a few million years after dinosaurs were gone forever. These animals have special teeth. Their teeth are sharp. They can bite together to cut through food. This is handy when they eat meat. There were two other groups of ancestors, too. They both lived before the Carnivora group. These animals were the same in some ways to cats and dogs.  For example, some walked on their toes like cats and dogs do. Other animals have skulls similar to whales and dolphins. No one knows exactly why these animals from long ago all died out. Carnivora animals have continued to live. One reason might be because of their larger brains. Scientists have been studying the beginnings of cats and dogs.  Dogs trace their beginnings to a relative shared with gray wolves. Over many, many years, dogs became pets. This probably started happening thousands of years ago. Cats might have first become pets in Egypt. This was more than 2,000 years ago. People also learned that they could breed different cats to get different fur colors.  So, whether we like cats or dogs more, goes back all those years ago to when people first started choosing them as pets.
