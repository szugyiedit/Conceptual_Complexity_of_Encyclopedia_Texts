Bacteria and fungi on surface of seawater may pose risk to Puget Sound orca population SEATTLE, Wash. — Scientists found germs in the breath of orca whales. Scientists are worried the germs will make the whales sick.  The scientists studied the whales who live in Puget Sound. Puget Sound is a bay in Washington State off of the Pacific Ocean. There are not many orca whales left in Puget Sound. They are running out of food. Pollution also hurts them. The orcas were listed as endangered in 2005\. There are only 78 left.  Scientists followed the whales on boats. When the whales came up to breathe, they took samples. They collected these samples for four years.  Scientists found some healthy germs in the samples. Some of the germs, though, are bad. These germs can cause serious illnesses.  The whales swim through waterways near cities. The water is full of waste. Waste in the water is harmful for the whales. This includes everything from what gets flushed down toilets to trash that was dumped in the wrong place.    Stephen Raverty led the study. He is a scientist who studies animal diseases. He says the orcas are breathing in germs in the water. Linda Rhodes is a scientist in Seattle, Washington. She participated in the study. She said that scientists do not know enough to say how harmful the germs are to the orcas.  This study is an important start, though. The results will help the scientists keep track of the whales' health.  Scientists keep records of how healthy the whales are. Each whale looks different, so they are easy to tell apart. Scientists take photos of the whales. Then, they are given a number and a name.
