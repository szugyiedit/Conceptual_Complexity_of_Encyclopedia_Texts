The endangered Asiatic cheetah's numbers are critical. One of the world's big cats is in danger of dying out. This cat is called the Asiatic cheetah. It can only be found in Iran. Iran is a country in the Middle East. Cheetahs are the fastest animal on Earth. They live in the wild. Only two of the cheetahs that still live in the wild are female. This is a problem because girl cheetahs have the babies, or cubs. The female cheetahs need male cheetah partners, but many of the cats are dying off. This is why the Asiatic cheetahs might die out. There are fewer than 40 still alive. Iran is trying to help save the animal. But the problem is only getting worse. Iran recently celebrated its national cheetah day. The day marks an event that happened many years ago. A group of villagers attacked a baby cheetah named Marita. They killed Marita's mother and two siblings. Now people remember Marita every year. A group in Iran is trying to save the cheetahs. They use cameras to find the big cats in the wild. A scientist named Morteza Eslami leads the group. Eslami said the problem was very bad. The number of female cheetahs dropped by a lot, he said. In the past 15 years, 48 cheetahs have died. Most were killed by people or cars. Eslami said helping the cheetahs is very important. Two other kinds of big cats already died out in Iran. A tiger and a lion. They do not want this to happen to the Asiatic cheetah. The cheetah group has even asked Iran's president for help. Scientists like Eslami still have hope. But they say more work needs to be done. People must get together to save the cheetah.
