Very last orca bred in confinement MIAMI, Florida — A new orca calf was just born at SeaWorld. The whale will be the last orca born in the theme park. Protests about animal rights and falling ticket sales have caused SeaWorld to stop breeding orcas.  SeaWorld said the orca was born last week on Wednesday. It is the last in a generation of whales born in confinement. SeaWorld did not immediately name the calf because the park's veterinarians had not yet determined whether it was male or female. The mother and calf both appear healthy says SeaWorld.  The mother, 25-year-old Takara, was already carrying the orca when SeaWorld announced in March 2016 that it had stopped breeding its whales. Orca pregnancy lasts for about 18 months. Earlier, SeaWorld's chief zoological officer, Chris Dold, told The Associated Press he expected the birth to be bittersweet. It would be the last such event at any of the parks. However, hours after the birth last Wednesday, Dold said, SeaWorld staff only felt like celebrating. "These are extraordinary moments," he said by phone while traveling to the U.S. from Abu Dhabi. SeaWorld is developing its first new park without orcas there. SeaWorld decided to stop breeding orcas and begin ending its world-famous killer whale performances, with final shows in 2019\. Public opinion has turned against keeping orcas, dolphins and other animals in theme parks like SeaWorld for entertainment. Many now think it is cruel to keep animals in spaces so much smaller than their natural habitat. They are also concerned that the whales are not treated well. The backlash intensified after the 2013 release of the documentary "Blackfish." The film is critical of SeaWorld's orca care. It focused on the orca Tilikum, who killed trainer Dawn Brancheau in Orlando in 2010.  Tilikum fathered 14 calves over nearly 25 years in Orlando. He died of natural causes in January. The newborn calf was fathered by Kyuquot at the San Antonio park. It brings SeaWorld's orca population in the U.S. to 23\. All the orcas are expected to remain on display and available to researchers for years to come at their Orlando, San Diego, and San Antonio locations. SeaWorld has said it will introduce new "natural orca encounters" in place of theatrical shows. This summer, the San Diego park will unveil a new, educational attraction in a newly designed pool and new orca attractions are planned to eventually follow in San Antonio and Orlando. Dold said veterinarians at the San Antonio park told him the calf was born normally. It came out tail first after about an hour and a half of smooth labor. Both orcas were swimming calmly and trainers were watching for the calf to begin nursing. "Mom generally will rest but she can't rest too much .... mom's not holding onto the calf, but it's riding in her slipstream, and that's how it gets around," Dold said. "Our expectation is that all of this will go smoothly, but we take none of that for granted." Birth control and "social management" will prevent future orca pregnancies, said spokeswoman Suzanne Pelisson Beasley. SeaWorld has not collected a wild orca in nearly 40 years. Most of its orcas were born in their theme parks. Researchers have said they worried about SeaWorld's decision to stop breeding orcas. It will slowly reduce their ability to study orca health, growth and behavior. In the coming years, they will be limited to studying a small pod of aging whales. Heather Hill is a St. Mary's University psychologist who studies animal behavior. She plans to monitor the sleeping habits of Takara and the calf over the coming year. She said it was frustrating to see research opportunities at SeaWorld undermined by public opinion as the federal government cuts funding for science. She said it would be one of the first times they would see a newborn calf with mother and siblings. Tracy Reiman is vice president for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She said the mother and her calf should be retired to a safe place in the ocean after a life living in SeaWorld. She said that Takara the whale has spent much of her life carrying calves for the theme park, then being separated from them as the park moves the whales at will.   This is Takara's fifth calf. Two of her other offspring remain at the San Antonio park, one lives at SeaWorld Orlando and another has been loaned to a park in Tenerife, Spain. SeaWorld has no current plans to separate Takara and the newborn in the future, or to move any of its other orcas, Dold said. Dold said in March that SeaWorld remains committed to orca research and conservation. He called the last orca birth in the theme park "a solemn reminder of how things can change and how things can be lost."
