Staff believe the common New Zealand octopus fled its enclosure when the lid was left ajar and headed to freedom down a pipe that leads to the sea. A sneaky octopus got out of his tank. He escaped from an aquarium. The aquarium is in New Zealand. The octopus is named Inky.  The workers think Inky got free late at night. No one was around. He climbed to the top of his glass tank. The lid was open a little bit. Inky climbed out. Then he slid down the side of the tank and went across the floor of the aquarium. He was free. Rob Yarrell works at the aquarium. He said octopuses are good at getting away. He did not think Inky was unhappy. He did not think Inky was lonely.  After all, octopuses like to be alone. Inky was just curious, Rob said. He wanted to know what was "happening on the outside."   Workers believe Inky slid across the floor. Then he squished into a drainpipe. It led him to the sea. His getaway was kind of like the movie "Finding Nemo." Rob was "really surprised" to find Inky's tank empty the next morning. He was also "pretty sad." Reiss Jenkinson works at the aquarium, too. He did not think Inky was “stolen.”  Reiss knows a lot about octopuses. Octopuses do not have bones. They can fit into very small spaces. They can squeeze through an opening as thin as a penny. Octopuses are very smart. They can even use tools. Inky used to live in the ocean. One day, he got stuck in a crayfish trap. The fisherman brought Inky to the aquarium. Inky was "rough looking," Rob said. He had been fighting with other fish. He was not in good shape. Inky is as big a football. Rob said he was a very friendly octopus. People loved Inky. The aquarium still hopes Inky will come home.
