It's home on the expanded mountain range for China's giant pandas. China is home to the giant panda bear. It is one of the world's most loved animals. Most pandas live in zoos and parks. Now, China is planning to build a new park for the giant panda. It is going to be huge.  The giant park will take up more than 10,000 square miles. That is about three times as big as Yellowstone National Park, one of the largest parks in the United States. China hopes that all this space will help the pandas. Right now, the animal is in danger. They could disappear if they are not protected. There are not many left in the world. The new park will bring together 67 smaller parks. Linking them will help the pandas meet each other. Once they meet, they might have more baby panda cubs. Pandas have been doing a bit better in recent years. The numbers of giant pandas rose in the last 10 years. But pandas are still in some danger.  About 1,864 pandas live in the wild. China wants to increase that number to 2,000 by 2025. Around 200 pandas live under human care. Their numbers are growing. Last year, 64 more cubs were born. In 2003, China started a new program to help pandas.  The pandas were raised with human care. The program helped bring them back to living in the wild. Seven pandas were put into the wild. So far, five remain in the wild and two have died.  The pandas' main threat is the loss of their habitat. Habitat is where they live. The land they call home is disappearing. Protections have helped to keep pandas safe. China hopes the new park will help even more. Not everyone is happy about the big panda park. Many people will have to move to make room for the park. Those people will have new homes. They might also get to work at the park.
