These salamanders are all girls Most animals have both a mother and a father. There is a certain kind of salamander living in Ohio that is different. They only have mothers. In fact, they are all girls. Scientists just finished a study of these salamanders. Robert Denton is a biologist. He was one of the scientists who worked on the study. He and his coworkers found that the all-girl salamanders are great at staying alive and having healthy children. The all-girl salamanders can have children all by themselves. They do so by cloning. Mothers make copies of themselves, rather than mating with boy salamanders.  Cloning has a downside, though. Children only get genes from a single parent. Genes are the main building blocks of life. They tell your body how to grow and work. They are passed on from parents to their children. Most animals get genes from both their mothers and fathers. Each parent gives the child one set of genes. These salamanders only get genes from their mothers. Normally, this might cause a problem. It helps animals to have two sets of genes. It makes it more likely they will be able to stay healthy. These salamanders are special. They have between two and five times the regular number of genes. Mothers have extra genes to pass on. Father salamanders are simply not needed. In fact, the all-girl salamanders do better than other salamanders in some ways.  When salamanders' tails are cut off, they can regrow them. The all-girl salamanders regrow their tails very quickly. It takes just 10 weeks. It takes regular salamanders 15 weeks.  Being able to quickly regrow a new tail makes a big difference. Salamanders' tails help them stay alive. If you are a salamander, it seems, you might be better off without boys.
