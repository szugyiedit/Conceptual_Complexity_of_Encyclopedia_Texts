Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands, and nearly got wiped out. They're making a comeback thanks to human intervention. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140428_BIGHORN_SHEEP.jpg" />FRESNO, Calif. — Fifteen years ago, things were looking bad for the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. There were just 105 of them scattered across the mountain range from which they take their name. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of them pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, located high in the mountains in Sequoia National Park. That marks a milestone: It’s the first time bighorn sheep have settled in the Great Western Divide in more than 100 years. It proves that human intervention can bring a species back from the [brink of extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). “This shows that recovery is actually" possible, says Daniel Gammons, a biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. “Most species that end up on the endangered species list don’t ever come off, and there’s a real opportunity here to see success.” It’s taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery. The Sierra Nevada bighorns once numbered in the thousands, until settlers started crossing the mountain range in the 1800s, bringing disease and hunting that nearly wiped out the sheep. In 1971, Sierra Nevada bighorns were one of the first animals listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. In 2000, the federal government added the bighorns to its endangered lists. “There was a lot of concern about extinction,” says state biologist Tom Stephenson, the recovery project leader. “But with some good fortune and the combination of the right recovery efforts, it’s gone as well as anybody could’ve imagined.” In 2000, teams of biologists and volunteers began their research. Seven years later, they started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorns by placing them into herds along the Sierra crest. The agencies selected 16 areas for bighorns, with the initial goal of repopulating 12 of them. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March is the 10th. Next on the list are Laurel Creek on the southern end of Sequoia National Park and Taboose Creek on the eastern border of Kings Canyon National Park. Recovery efforts date back to the 1970s when the bighorn population declined to one area — Wheeler Ridge on the northern edge of Kings Canyon. The herd became the source population for recovery efforts in the 1970s and 1980s that introduced sheep to Mono Basin east of Yosemite and Mount Baxter and Mount Williamson east of Kings Canyon and Sequoia. Now, at a cost of about $600,000 per year, agencies take a few animals from four source herds that can support removal to create new herds. Stephenson says that because ewes only birth one lamb per year, he believes it will be another decade before 12 herds are repopulated. Currently, the estimated 500-plus bighorn sheep are roughly half females and half males. The goal is to have 305 adult and yearling females among the entire population. Spotting a bighorn in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack. They’re masters of disguise, blending in with the rocky and snowy mountainsides of the high country with camouflage-like fur. Bighorns use excellent vision to spot predators and then use the rugged terrain as a means of escape. They can live anywhere from 11,000 to 14,000 feet in the warmer months, Stephenson says. During the coldest months, the sheep may migrate to as low as 6,000 feet. To monitor the animals in their remote mountainous setting, Stephenson and his team must hike into the backcountry. The animals that are relocated are captured with net guns fired out of circling helicopters. Each bighorn is captured individually. It is examined, fitted with a collar transmitter and then placed in a box to be flown to a specific herd. There are some concerns right now about California's drought. One in the mid-1990s significantly cut into the population. But Stephenson and his team hope that the way the herds are being spread out will allow the sheep to survive and continue to grow in numbers. Recreation has not been affected by the project, says Dana Dierkes, spokeswoman for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. However, regular sheep grazing in national forests has been banned to ensure the health and survival of the bighorn. It’s already prohibited in national parks. Grazing sheep have sometimes introduced disease into bighorn herds. Among other ailments, bighorns have fallen victim to pinkeye and pneumonia.
