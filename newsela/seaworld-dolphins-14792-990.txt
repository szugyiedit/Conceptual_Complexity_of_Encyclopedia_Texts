SeaWorld will keep fewer dolphins ORLANDO, Fla. — There are the typical rides at SeaWorld's Aquatica water park, but there are also four unusual creatures: Commerson’s dolphins. The animals are known for swimming upside down and for their black and white markings that make them look like mini-killer whales. They likely will be the last of their kind in the United States. SeaWorld’s dolphin collection has dwindled over the years. The company doesn’t plan to breed or replace the aging dolphins. “Once these animals … go away, that’s going to be it for the species for the SeaWorld parks,” said Brad Andrews, the chief zoological officer. It’s “kind of sad, in a way, because people will never be able to see them anymore.” After years apart, SeaWorld recently brought together a group from its San Diego, California, park with two others at Aquatica in Florida. It was a bittersweet reunion. One died a week after making the trip. There are a few others in captivity in Japan, kept in zoos or parks. However, importing them appears tough. Commerson’s dolphins are still found in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere, but SeaWorld recently pledged not to take whales or dolphins captured after early 2014. Animal rights supporters say SeaWorld will likely have to eventually stop exhibiting other types of animals as replacing them becomes too hard. After its last polar bear died in 2014, SeaWorld Orlando did not replace him. The theme park said it had too many difficulties obtaining more. SeaWorld also recently abandoned a controversial plan to import beluga whales caught in Russia a few years ago.  SeaWorld says it has had more success breeding other animals. With the Commerson’s dolphins, though, “when you start with 12, there’s not enough genetic diversity,” Andrews said. With an estimated life span of less than 20 years, “they don’t live very long,” Andrews added. “That sort of stopped the program.” Some animal rights activists say the dolphins’ short lives demonstrate the problems of captivity. “It’s a depressing story,” said Nick Atwood, campaign coordinator for Animal Rights Foundation of Florida. SeaWorld, meanwhile, believes the dolphins have taught visitors and scientists about their friends in the wild. Andrews noted that SeaWorld has published scientific papers after studying everything from their behavior to blood. In 1983, SeaWorld started with a dozen from the wild. Scientists wanted SeaWorld to study the dolphins, which were threatened by fishermen who caught them to use as crab bait. Six died in 1983 and 1984, according to government records. There were 14 births through 2001 of Commerson’s dolphins that lived more than a month. The dolphins moved from place to place. Some went to SeaWorld in Ohio before it closed but mostly they lived in San Diego. Four came to Orlando when Aquatica opened in 2008.   In 2014, two Orlando dolphins died of liver failure within about three months of each other. In San Diego, the others were part of an exhibit before they were moved to behind-the-scenes pools in 2011. At one point, they moved in with beluga whales. One beluga exhibited dominant behavior, so the dolphins had to go. One of the original captured dolphins, 33-year-old Betsy, started eating irregularly after arriving in Orlando last month and quickly died. Betsy appeared healthy in examinations before the trip, according to Chris Dold, a SeaWorld veterinarian. He said another dolphin around the same age has done fine.   Some people have questioned why the animals were moved, particularly the elderly ones. Atwood, of the animal rights group, is one of them. “I think it points to how zoos and aquariums often treat animals as kind of playing cards they can kind of shuffle around," he said. SeaWorld said it wanted to reunite the dolphins in a place people could connect with them. Dold says the question now is whether the stress of the trip contributed to Betsy's death.  Shannon Cremeans is head of the group Ceta-Base, which tracks captive dolphins. She thinks SeaWorld has generally done the best it could. She said it “is both interesting and impressive that SeaWorld has maintained the species for over 30 years based on a small founding group of animals, especially taking into consideration how little was known about caring for this species at the time.”
