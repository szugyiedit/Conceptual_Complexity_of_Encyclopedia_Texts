Study uses ultrasound on sharks MIAMI, Fla. — Scientists were puzzled. They could not figure out why so many tiger sharks were coming to an area of water near the Bahamas each year. The waters were warm and shallow. Now a team of scientists may have the answer. They used pictures made from sound waves to figure it out. These are called ultrasound. University of Miami shark expert Neil Hammerschlag is one of the scientists. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/sharkultrasound.png) The area of water is called Tiger Beach. Hammerschlag first began diving in Tiger Beach in 2003\. He noticed something surprising. Nearly all the sharks were female. The sharks could be attracted by food tossed into the water by tour operators, Hammerschlag said. But there were not any males. So maybe the reason the female sharks were there had something to do with having babies, he thought. Scientists do not know a lot about how sharks have babies. Until now, scientists had to kill and cut open sharks to study how they have babies. Scientists do not like to do this. So Hammerschlag and scientist James Sulikowsky looked for a different method. They thought about the way humans confirm pregnancies. You do not have to kill humans to tell if they are pregnant, Hammerschlag said. "Thank goodness."  The job was more difficult than examining a human, though. The scientists had to do their work in the water. They were examining a man-eating shark. The shark is 14 feet long and can weigh as much as 1,400 pounds.  Movable, waterproof ultrasound machines made the job easier. The machines use sound waves to make images. They are lightweight and easy to move. Scientists also have goggles to view images instead of looking at a screen. Getting the sharks to keep still was difficult. Scientists did not want the sharks to bite a chunk out of the doctor. The behavior was understandable, though. Sharks are pregnant for 16 months, after all. It helps to be an expert shark hunter. First the team put bait on fishing lines, which were attached to a secure floating drum. Once a shark was hooked, the team pulled it in. When the shark was close to the boat, a team member roped the shark’s tail and pulled it out of the water. Other members then wrestled the shark onto an underwater platform. They put a pipe into its mouth to pump water with extra oxygen over the shark’s gills. The ultrasound was done. Researchers also drew the shark's blood. The exam took about 20 minutes. The pipe acted like a pacifier and calmed the shark. This helped protect the scientists, since sharks bite when they are not calm. The extra oxygen in the pumped water also relaxed the sharks. Scientists caught 65 sharks between 2011 and 2014, and 59 were females. Some were pregnant. Younger females were also present. There were no baby sharks. The area does not have much food for sharks to eat. The water is warm and mostly calm, however. Scientists think the warm water helps the babies grow inside the mothers.  The waters are in a special area where fishing can be controlled. Because of this, scientists believe their work might show how efforts to protect the tiger sharks have helped. Many shark groups are getting smaller in the Atlantic, Hammerschlag said. The tiger shark groups seem to be getting bigger, he said. Tiger Beach may be helping, he added.
