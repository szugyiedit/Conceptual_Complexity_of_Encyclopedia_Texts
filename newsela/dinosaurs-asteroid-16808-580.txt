Dinosaurs in trouble before asteroid hit Scientists have believed that a giant asteroid that struck the Earth killed off the dinosaurs. It was a very long time ago. The asteroid hit caused huge waves and earthquakes. There were fires and dust storms that blocked the sun. Dinosaurs could not survive. What if the asteroid had glided safely past our planet? Would dinosaurs still be with us today? New studies say the answer is probably not. Instead, scientists have found that dinosaurs were becoming fewer. That was even before the asteroid hit the Earth. Scientists have always studied dinosaurs by looking at fossils. They are like footprints left long ago by animals or plants. Fossils are found in rocks and can teach scientists about life millions of years ago. Some scientists had a new plan. They looked at all the different kinds of dinosaurs. Some were starting to struggle long before the asteroid hit.  Some kinds of dinosaurs were starting to disappear. Meanwhile, not as many new kinds were beginning to grow. In the time before the asteroid hit, the Earth was changing. It became very cold. Volcanoes were erupting. Lands were beginning to break apart.  Any of those events could have hurt the dinosaurs, the scientists said. But they are not sure. Another new study looked at mammals. They were just small, rodent-like animals back then. Yet they might have begun to eat some of the food and water dinosaurs needed. Scientists believe the rise of mammals might have helped to push the dinosaurs off the planet.
