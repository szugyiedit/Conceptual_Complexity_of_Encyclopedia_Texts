Odd-looking animal rediscovered by scientists in Central Africa David Fernandez peered at the odd-looking creature, sitting at the bottom of a plastic container. He hoped it was the real thing. Fernandez had worked on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea in Africa for 14 years, but he'd never seen one of these animals before. No modern scientist ever had. Fernandez lifted the dead animal out of its container and snapped a photo with his phone. Then he texted the image to scientist Erik Seiffert. One of the few people in the world who would recognize it, Seiffert is a paleontologist at University of Southern California and studies fossils. Seiffert immediately texted back: That's Zenkerella. "I think he was even more excited than I was," Fernandez recalled. "It was amazing, the first entire specimen available for us, and for science basically." Zenkerella insignis, the creature caught on Bioko, is one of the world's most ancient and mysterious mammals. Until now, it was known only by its fossils and a handful of old specimens. There wasn't much information about it, and no scientist has ever seen it alive. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/zenkerella.jpg) For the first time, scientists were able to examine the genome of one of the strange mammals. The genome contains the instructions for how each part of the body works and is passed on from parents to children. Seiffert, Fernandez and other scientists published their findings Tuesday in PeerJ, an online magazine for scientists. Members of the Zenkerella genus are creatures of another world. They are "living fossils" that have changed very little over the past 49 million years. They're only about 15 million years younger than the dinosaurs, and about 35 million years older than the oldest great apes. "We don't know when it is active, or what it eats, or if it spends all of its time in the trees or on the ground," Seiffert said. Fifteen years ago, Seiffert and other scientists found the fossil of an ancient animal that was closely related to the Zenkerella. He became certain that the living Zenkerellas could tell scientists a great deal about how rodents changed over time and the changes that have taken place in Africa in the past 50 million years. But first, he would have to find one. So he reached out to Fernandez, who at the time was the director of a wildlife center in Bioko. Fernandez is a conservation biologist, but he'd never even heard of Zenkerella before. When he spoke to other scientists, most of them hadn't heard of it either. Fernandez showed his neighbors a picture of the funny little creature and asked them to keep an eye out for it. Most of the island's residents are hunters, and eventually, he figured that someone would probably catch a Zenkerella in a trap. Weeks passed, and then months. Finally, almost a year later, Fernandez got a call. A person said "We got one of your guys," he recalled. "I took a look, and it was one of them." The Zenkerella looks pretty much like how its ancestors would have looked. It is a squirrel-like creature with fluffy black fur and a poof of a tail. But beneath all that hair, the base of the tail is covered in scales. Indeed, Zenkerella is the ultimate survivor. Of the 5,400 mammal species known to science, only it and five others are the last members of ancient families. Not much is known about it. That's bad news for Zenkerella, whose habitat in Central Africa is under threat. Since scientists have never seen the animal alive in the wild, they're not entirely sure where they live, or how many of them there are left. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/Zenkerella_Bioko.png) We don't know for certain that Zenkerella is in danger, but we don't know that it isn't, either. For now, the scientists are trying to understand the genetic roots of their strange and ancient traits. They're also looking at the contents of the animals' stomachs, which will help show what Zenkerellas eat — and hopefully where they live. Seiffert holds out hope that he might yet see a Zenkerella in action, a living ghost of the ancient world. "It really is one of those pretty incredible examples of discovery," Seiffert said. It is also "a sign of the kinds of discoveries that can still be made."
