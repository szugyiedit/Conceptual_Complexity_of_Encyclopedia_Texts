Zenkerella, world's most ancient and mysterious mammal, is finally found David Fernandez peered at the odd-looking critter, which he'd spent the better part of the past year trying to track down. Sitting in alcohol at the bottom of a plastic container, its black fur was dark and matted, and its tail was curled. Fernandez hoped it was the real thing. Fernandez had worked on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea, a country in Africa, for 14 years, but he'd never seen one of these animals before. No modern scientist ever had. He lifted the specimen out of its container and snapped a photo with his phone. Then he texted the image to scientist Erik Seiffert. One of the few people in the world who would recognize the creature, Seiffert is a paleontologist at University of Southern California. Seiffert immediately texted back: That's Zenkerella. "I think he was even more excited than I was," Fernandez recalled. "It was amazing, the first entire specimen available for us, and for science basically." Zenkerella insignis, the critter caught on Bioko, is one of the world's most ancient and mysterious mammals. Until now, it was known only by its fossils and 11 specimens, many of which had been in natural history collections for over 100 years. Researchers had little to go on, and no scientist in history has ever seen it alive. But, in a study published Tuesday in the journal PeerJ, Fernandez, Seiffert and other scientists describe the capture of three freshly killed Z. insignis specimens. For the first time, scientists were able to examine the genome of one of the bizarre mammals. They looked at the creature's DNA, which controls how every part of the human body develops and functions, and finally figure out where Zenkerella fits in our evolutionary family tree. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/zenkerella.jpg) Members of the Zenkerella genus are creatures of another world, "living fossils" that have evolved very little over the past 49 million years. They're only about 15 million years younger than the dinosaurs, and some 35 million years older than the oldest great apes. When they first arose, Australia was still connected to Antarctica, and the Himalayas didn't even exist yet. "It's a long lineage that stretches all the way back 50 million years, and we only have one species left that we don’t know anything about," Seiffert said. "We don't know when it is active, or what it eats, or if it spends all of its time in the trees or on the ground." That's extremely unusual for mammals, which are among the best-researched  creatures on Earth. Fifteen years ago, Seiffert and other scientists found a fossil of a Zenkerella cousin. He was certain that the living Zenkerellas could tell scientists a great deal about rodent evolution, not to mention the changes that have taken place in Africa in the past 50 million years. But first, he would have to find one. So he reached out to Fernandez, who was then the director of a wildlife center run by the Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program. Fernandez is a conservation biologist, but he'd never even heard of a Zenkerella before, and when he spoke to other scientists, most of them hadn't heard of it either. But Seiffert told him that Zenkerella specimens had been spotted on Bioko before, so Fernandez showed his neighbors a picture of the funny little creature and asked them to keep an eye out for it. Most of the island's residents are hunters, and eventually, someone would probably catch a Zenkerella in one of their traps. Weeks passed, and then months. Finally, almost a year later, Fernandez got a call from a colleague. "They said, 'We got one of your guys,'" he recalled. "I took a look, and it was one of them." The living Zenkerella is a squirrel-like creature with fluffy black fur and a poof of a tail, but the base of its tail is covered in scales. Indeed, Zenkerella is the ultimate survivor. Of the 5,400 mammal species known to science, only it and five others are the sole surviving members of ancient families, but it is the least studied. That's bad news for Zenkerella, whose habitat in Central Africa is under threat. Since scientists have never seen the animal alive in the wild, they're not entirely sure where they live, or how many of them there are left. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/Zenkerella_Bioko.png) "These small obscure animals, they’re not getting the attention they would actually need to confirm their distribution," Seiffert said. We don't know for certain that Zenkerella is threatened, but we don't know that it isn't, either. For now, the scientists are trying to understand the genetic roots of their strange and ancient traits. They're analyzing the contents of the animal's gut, which will help researchers understand what they eat — and hopefully track down where they live. After all those years looking at fossils, Seiffert holds out hope that he might yet see a Zenkerella in action, a living ghost of the ancient world. "It really is one of those pretty incredible examples of discovery," Seiffert said, "and a sign of the kinds of discoveries that can still be made."
