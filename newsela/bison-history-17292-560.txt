Nearly wiped out in a bid to demolish Native American resistance, the bison’s history paints a picture of strife and redemption that mirrors the U.S.’s own The bison will be a new symbol for America. The symbol will tell other countries what America stands for. The United States picked the bison to be its national mammal. The other animal is the bald eagle. The story of the bison tells much about the history of America. A bison is also called a buffalo. It can weigh 2,000 pounds. A bison is 6 feet tall and has a beard under its chin. It also has curved horns. Just over 100 years ago, bison were almost completely gone from the U.S. In the 1700s, there were about 30 million bison. It was in the early days of the United States. The country was just starting. The bison lived on the lands belonging to Native Americans. These groups of people lived in the country before European settlers arrived. Then, more and more settlers came to the United States. They made homes on lands where the bison lived. The bison were killed by hunters. Some animals got sick. Soon they were almost all gone. There were about 1,000 left. The U.S. Army wiped out the bison. They did this to hurt the Native Americans. The Native Americans needed bison for food and clothes. The army said that other people could kill as many bison as they wanted. The animal skins were used to make leather.  The Native Americans gave up their lands after many bison were killed. The people did not have as much bison to eat. Their way of life was gone. The Native Americans were sent to live on land that the U.S. government set aside for them. Things started to get better for the bison in the 1900s. A group was formed to save the bison. New bison were born at a zoo in New York City. Then, they were moved to national parks. A national park is a place where the animals and land are protected.  There was a herd of bison in Yellowstone National Park. It started with 24 bison. The park is in the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Now, there are more than 5,000 in the herd.  There are now 30,000 bison that roam free in the United States.  Jim Stone works for a group of Native Americans. He is happy that the bison has now become a symbol for the U.S. It will "help us talk about the buffalo,” he said.
