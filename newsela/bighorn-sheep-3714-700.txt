The sheep numbered only 105 about 15 years ago. Now, there are 500 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep in the California mountain range from which they take their name. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140428_BIGHORN_SHEEP.jpg" />FRESNO, Calif. — There were once thousands of Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. Then, in the 1800s, settlers started crossing the mountain range. With them came disease and hunting that [nearly wiped out the sheep](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Fifteen years ago, things were looking bad for Sierra Nevada bighorns. There were just 105 of them left. They were scattered across the mountain range from which they take their name. Today, they number more than 500. And just last month, 14 sheep were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon. This spot is located high in the mountains in Sequoia National Park. Nine of the sheep were pregnant. The park's new dwellers are big news: It’s the first time bighorn sheep have been in this part of the mountain range in more than 100 years. It proves that they can be saved from extinction. In other words, it is possible to keep them from dying out. Coming back from near extinction is known as _recovery_. “This shows that recovery is actually" possible, says biologist Daniel Gammons. Most animals that get close to extinction don't recover. However, he said, "there’s a real opportunity here to see success.” It’s taken more than 10 years of careful study to make it happen. Tom Stephenson is leading the recovery project. “There was a lot of concern about extinction,” he said. However, things have "gone as well as anybody could’ve imagined.” In 2000, teams of biologists began studying the problem. In 2007, they started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn. They began placing them into herds along the Sierra crest. Sixteen areas were selected for the bighorns. To start out with, only 12 areas will be used. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March is the 10th herd so far. Recovery efforts date back to the 1970s. At that point, very few bighorns were left. They lived in just one area: Wheeler Ridge. The herd there became the "source population" for recovery efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. In other words, sheep were taken from Wheeler Ridge and brought to various other areas. That way, new populations had a chance to develop. Now, four source herds are being used to build new herds. These are large enough to lose several animals at a time. Female sheep only give birth to one lamb a year. That means the growth of herds is slow. It will likely take another 10 years to meet the goal of 12 new herds. Currently, out of 500 bighorn sheep, half are females and half are males. The goal is to have 305 females. Spotting a bighorn in the wild is very tricky. Their camouflage-like fur makes them masters of disguise: They blend in with the rocky and snowy mountainsides. Bighorns use their excellent vision to spot danger. They then use the rugged rocks as a means of escape: Few animals can scurry up a steep mountainside as fast as they can. The bighorn sheep can live as high up as 14,000 feet. During the colder months, they move down to as low as 6,000 feet. Sheep that are resettled are captured with net guns fired out of circling helicopters. Each bighorn is captured individually. It is examined and fitted with a tracking device. Then it is placed in a box and flown to a new herd. So far, things have been going smoothly. Stephenson hopes that bighorns will continue to grow in numbers. Soon, they may once again fill the Sierra Nevada mountains.
