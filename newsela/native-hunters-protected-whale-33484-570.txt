Gray whales are a protected species ANCHORAGE, Alaska — A gray whale was killed last week. Now, investigators are working to find out if the fishermen broke the law. Gray whales are protected by law. There are not many of them still alive in the world. For this reason, there are strict rules against killing them. There is more to the story, though. The fishermen who killed the whale are Native Alaskan. They have lived in Alaska for a long time, long before Alaska became a state. Native Alaskans do not have to follow the same hunting rules as other people. The reason is because hunting and fishing is very important to Native Alaskans. It is a way of life for them. Native communities hunt and fish to feed their families and communities.   The whale was 37 feet long. After it died, it sank to the bottom of the Kuskokwim River. It happened near a village called Napaskiak. The whale's body was later taken onto land. It was cut up, resulting in 20,000 pounds of meat and fat. It was then shared among several villages. Sue Fisher works at the Animal Welfare Institute. She said that even Native Alaskans "are not allowed to take gray whales." Many Native Alaskans believe the river brought them the gray whale. They don't think it just swam there by accident. They see it as a gift. They feel it would be wrong not to accept it. Bill Howell is the fire chief in the nearby community of Bethel. He was there when the whale's body was being prepared. In fact, he helped cut it up. He said Alaska Natives should be able to hunt whales. It's a big part of their way of life, he said. Sharon Williams feels the same. She is a tribal administrator in Napaskiak.  Williams watched the whale being prepared. She described a moment right before it was cut into.  A community leader spoke to the whale, she said. He thanked it.
