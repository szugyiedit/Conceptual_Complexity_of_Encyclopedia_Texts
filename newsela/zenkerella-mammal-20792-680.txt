Zenkerella, world's most ancient and mysterious mammal, is rediscovered David Fernandez looked at the odd-looking creature at the bottom of a plastic container. He hoped it was the real thing. For 14 years, Fernandez had worked on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea, an African country. He had never seen one of these animals before. No modern scientist ever had. Fernandez lifted the dead rodent out of its container and took a photo with his phone. Then he texted the image to scientist Erik Seiffert. Seiffert is a paleontologist at the University of Southern California. Paleontologists study fossils. Seiffert is one of the few people in the world who would recognize the creature. Seiffert immediately texted back. That's Zenkerella, he said. "I think he was even more excited than I was," Fernandez remembered. "It was amazing, the first entire specimen available." The creature caught on Bioko is called Zenkerella insignis. It is one of the world's most ancient and mysterious animals. Until now, scientists knew about it from fossils and some old specimens. There wasn't much information about it, and no scientist has ever seen it alive. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/zenkerella.jpg) "We don't know when it is active, or what it eats," Seiffert said. Scientists don't know where it lives. They don't even know if it spends all of its time in the trees or on the ground. For the first time, scientists were able to look at the genome of one of the strange mammals. The genome is made of DNA and contains the information that tells your body how to grow and work. It is your body's instruction manual. DNA is passed on from parents to children. Seiffert, Fernandez and other scientists published their findings in PeerJ, an online magazine for scientists. The Zenkerella are creatures of another world. They are "living fossils" that have changed very little over the past 49 million years. They're only about 15 million years younger than the dinosaurs. Scientists know of about 5,400 mammals. Zenkerella and five others are the last living members of ancient families. Seiffert was certain that the living Zenkerellas could tell scientists a great deal about how rodents changed over time. It would also tell them how Africa has changed in the past 50 million years. First, though, Seiffert would have to find one. So he reached out to Fernandez. At the time, Fernandez was the head of a wildlife center in Bioko. Fernandez had never even heard of the Zenkerella before, and when he spoke to other scientists, most of them hadn't heard of it either. ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/Zenkerella_Bioko.png) Fernandez showed his neighbors a picture of the funny little creature. He asked them to keep an eye out for it. Weeks passed, and then months. Finally, almost a year later, Fernandez got a call. A person said "We got one of your guys," he said. "I took a look, and it was one of them." The Zenkerella looks about the same as its ancestors probably looked. It looks like a squirrel with fluffy black fur and a poof of a tail. The base of the tail is covered in scales. For now, the scientists are trying to understand the strange and ancient creature. They're also looking at the contents of the animals' stomachs. The remains of its last meals will show what Zenkerellas eat and hopefully where they live. Seiffert hopes that he might see a Zenkerella in action. Even a dead Zenkerella is a pretty incredible discovery, Seiffert said. It is also "a sign of the kinds of discoveries that can still be made."
