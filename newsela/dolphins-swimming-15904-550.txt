Dolphins at rest: "Do not disturb" WAIANAE, Hawaii — Allison Alterman lives on Hawaii's Big Island. She likes to swim in the ocean. Sometimes she sees dolphins swimming nearby. When the dolphins stay put, boats show up. The boats drop off passengers in the water to swim with the dolphins. Alterman said that's a problem. The dolphins can't rest "because they're surrounded." Ann Garrett works for the U.S. government. She said that boats sometimes chase dolphins and get in their way. Now the government wants new rules to help protect the dolphins. It could make a rule against swimming with them. It is already against the law to bother dolphins. Claudia Merrill works at a company called Dolphin Discoveries. The company takes people to see dolphins. Merrill said new rules would be a good idea. People should not be allowed to swim with dolphins during the day, she said. These dolphins eat fish at night. They also eat small crabs. In the morning, the dolphins go to shallow water. That way they can hide from sharks and other animals that might want to eat them. Jennifer Hall lives in Chicago. She went on a trip to see dolphins in Hawaii. Some people tried to follow the dolphins, but the guides stopped them. The guides told people to "observe not disturb." Their boat was together with about five other boats. The boats made a big half-circle around the animals. Hall said she felt peacefulness while she watched the dolphins. Seeing them in the wild "was really wonderful," she said.
