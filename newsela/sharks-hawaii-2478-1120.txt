Shark attacks increased in both 2013 and 2012. And two tourists were killed by sharks last year. The fierce tiger shark is believed to be the culprit in many of the attacks. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140117_HAWAII_SHARKS.jpg" />MAKENA STATE PARK, Hawaii — There was a record number of shark attacks on people in the Hawaiian islands last year. So sharks were not far from Colin Dececco’s mind as the sun went down on the long white strip of sand here on a recent Sunday evening. Dececco and his daughter had a close encounter with a reef shark while swimming around a rocky cove at Makena’s Big Beach on the island of Maui that morning. Later that day, they watched a spear fisherman haul in his catch as they strolled by the same spot at sunset. Suddenly they heard a splash at the edge of the fisherman's net. It was an 8-foot-long tiger shark, one of the fiercest shark species in Hawaii’s waters. The tiger shark is the likely culprit for many of the 14 attacks in 2013, eight of which occurred near Makena’s beaches. Releasing his net, the fisherman took off running down the shoreline, shouting for swimmers to get out of the water. “By then everyone was kind of running,” Dececco said in an interview just moments after he and his daughter had scrambled up a rocky cliff for a better view. “Tiger sharks — you don’t play with them,” he warned. In a state where tourism drives the economy, the rise in shark encounters has alarmed visitors and business owners alike. Two people died after attacks in 2013 — a German snorkeler and a Washington state kayak fisherman. Both incidents occurred in the waters near Makena State Park. But there are no permanent warning signs on the coastline, despite scores of hotels and tourists. For many years the state has posted notices and closed the beach immediately after a shark attack. The beach then remains shut until noon the next day, if officials on helicopter and jet ski patrols believe that the shark has left the vicinity. For now, the government sees no need to change that policy. William Aila Jr. is chairman of Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources. He said there is no set pattern to the shark attacks and over time they have just come in spikes and lulls. But soon after the German tourist died in August 2013, the agency announced a new two-year, $186,000 study by the University of Hawaii. This research will look at whether tiger sharks spend more time around Maui beaches than the other Hawaiian islands and why. Shark attacks increased in both 2013 and 2012. In the three years before that, there were just three incidents per year. But, so far, the large number of recent attacks does not appear to have affected tourism in Hawaii. More than 2.1 million people visited Maui last year. Tourism officials believe visitors to Hawaii realize that shark attacks are still very rare. There is no question, however, that many swimmers and snorkelers are adjusting their routines based on the location of encounters. No pattern has emerged linking the likelihood of a shark attack with the distance from shore. The kayak fisherman was 900 yards off Makena, while the German snorkeler was 50 yards offshore. But a number of tourists said that they were not swimming out as far because of the sharks. Karen O’Brien, a 49-year-old tourist from Toronto, said she only went into the water as deep as her waist. Last year, O’Brien snorkeled off Molokini, a small island off the southwest coast of Maui. But after she read that the kayak fisherman was also attacked near Molokini, she decided that she wasn't interested in snorkeling there any more. Hawaii native Lorraine Alesna has long fished at Makena Landing. This is a popular launching spot for kayakers and snorkelers. She shook her head at the jet skiers, kite surfers and other tourists who zoomed into the waves without paying proper attention to the possibility of sharks. Sharks produce their babies during the winter months and attacks on humans are much more likely at that time. People should also avoid cloudy water that attracts the predators, but tourists don't always do this. “People that come from the mainland have no respect for anything, neither the ocean nor the land,” Alesna said about the visitors to her island. “We grew up knowing, by the elders, what we can and cannot do in certain times of the year.” Like many longtime residents and fishermen here, Alesna offers lots of theories for the rise in shark attacks. She thinks that sharks might be coming closer to the beach in search of green sea turtles to eat. These turtles were in danger of dying out until they were protected by law in 1978. The turtle populations have recovered a bit in Hawaii. Alesna says it is now time for officials to allow people to start hunting the turtles again. But Carl Meyer, a marine biologist leading the University of Hawaii study, said there was no evidence to support the theory that the sharks were coming closer to humans because of the turtles. Turtles, for example, are just one part of the broad diet favored by tiger sharks. These sharks are known as the “garbage cans” of the ocean because they will swallow anything and everything they find. Many non-edible items, such as car license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs, have all been found in the stomachs of tiger sharks. Many people think that there are more tiger sharks in the water and that they are hungrier than in past years. Meyer doesn't agree with this. Yet the scientist does know that there are definitely more fishermen, surfers and paddle boarders in the ocean than ever before. So his study will look at whether tiger sharks are more common in areas of Maui where those sports are most popular.
