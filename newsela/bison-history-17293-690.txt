Nearly wiped out in a bid to demolish Native American resistance, the bison’s history paints a picture of strife and redemption that mirrors the U.S.’s own The United States has chosen the bison as its first national mammal. The animal will be a symbol for America. It will join the bald eagle, which holds a position as America's national bird. The bison is also called a buffalo. It is 6 feet tall and can weigh 2,000 pounds. It has curved horns and also looks like it has a beard under its chin. William Clay is a lawmaker in Congress. He supports the bison becoming a new national symbol. Clay says that no other animal tells America’s story. Just over 100 years ago, bison were almost completely gone from the U.S. In the mid 1700s, at least 30 million bison roamed the U.S. As the number of people in the country grew, more people moved to the land where the bison lived. The bison were killed by hunters or got sick. By 1889, just over 1,000 bison were left. The U.S. Army wiped out the bison. It did this to control the Native Americans. The Native Americans needed the animals for food and clothes. The army said that people could kill as many bison as they wanted. A skilled hunter could kill 250 of the animals in a day. One person shot 120 bison in just 40 minutes. The animals’ tongues and hides were used to make leather.  When Native Americans saw the decline in bison, they decided to leave their land. They could not keep up their way of life. The U.S. government sent the Native Americans to live on land reserved for them. Things started to get better for the bison in the 1900s. Scientist John Muir, future president Theodore Roosevelt and William Hornaday paid attention to the bison. Hornaday was the first leader of the Bronx Zoo. It is in New York City.  The American Bison Society was then formed. It was a group that worked to save the bison. Baby bison were born and raised at the Bronx Zoo. Then, they were moved to national parks. A national park is a place where the animals and land are protected. There was a herd of 24 bison started in Yellowstone National Park. The park is in the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Now there are more than 5,000 in the herd.   The group's work paid off. There is now a network of national parks like Yellowstone. Today, there are 30,000 bison that roam free, and 400,000 more that are raised on ranches. After some time, people started to think about protecting other kinds of animals. They did not think about bison as much. However, the American Bison Society is fighting to get more attention for the bison. The fact that the bison is now the national mammal will help. Jim Stone works for a group of Native Americans called the Inter Tribal Buffalo Council. The group tries to remember that the buffaloes were sacred to their culture. It is excited about the new national symbol. It will "help us talk about the buffalo culture in today’s society,” Stone said.
