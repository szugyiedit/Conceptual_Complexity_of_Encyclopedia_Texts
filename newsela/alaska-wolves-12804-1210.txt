Mill vs. wolf in Alaskan forest The story of the wolves, the island and the ancient Alaskan forest began long before there were struggling sawmills and endangered species. All three have become main characters in a battle for balance between ecosystems and economies in the West. The wolf is known as the Alexander Archipelago wolf, a relative of the more common gray wolf that roams mainland North America. The island is Prince of Wales Island, an outpost 55 miles northwest of Ketchikan, Alaska. At nearly 2,600 square miles, it is home to just 6,000 people and accessible from the mainland only by boat or plane. And the forest is the 17 million-acre Tongass National Forest. The government says the forest is the "most intact temperate rain forest on Earth.” <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20151028_ALASKA_WOLVES.png" /> This spring, with the approval of the U.S. Forest Service, loggers began cutting thousands of acres of old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar on Prince of Wales Island. An old-growth forest has developed over a long time without significant destruction from fires or logging. Some of the Tongass evergreens are 800 years old and more than 200 feet tall. It is one of the largest and most controversial timber sales in the Tongass in two decades. State and federal officials say the project is essential to the livelihoods of people on the island. The last remaining large sawmill there employs about 50 people. Yet the wolf population in that area has been in steady decline, and cutting down more trees is expected to pressure them further. The animals make their dens in the roots of very large trees and prey on deer that live beneath the forest’s dense canopy. Roads built for logging cause problems too, dividing animal habitats and providing easier access for hunters to shoot and trap wolves, sometimes illegally. Just two decades ago, Prince of Wales was home to about 300 wolves. Now, state officials estimate that as few as 50 remain — about one wolf for every person working in the sawmill. By the end of this year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to make a final decision on whether the wolf should be listed as an endangered species. Meanwhile, logging continues, as does hunting, of both wolves and the deer that are their food supply. “They’re logging up a storm out there,” said Owen Graham, executive director of the Alaska Forest Association, a timber industry group. “They’re trying to get wood ahead of the winter.” But all that could come to an end if the wolf is declared endangered. Federal regulators could reduce or stop logging and hunting or both if they decide that either is putting wolves at risk of extinction. Conservationists say they want to protect the species and the landscape that sustains the animals. Climate change has made the battles more complicated, raising questions about which species should be priorities and whether they can even be saved. At the heart of the debate in southeast Alaska is the so-called Tongass transition. The Forest Service has described the plan as an economic and environmental bridge, providing just enough old-growth timber to keep the region’s few remaining sawmills running while slowly shifting the industry toward logging younger trees planted in areas previously cut. The timber industry in southeast Alaska is a fraction of what it used to be before federal regulations began limiting old-growth logging in the 1990s. The industry supports fewer than 300 jobs in the region, compared with the 3,500 workers it employed two decades ago. While the industry has plummeted, others, including tourism and fishing, have grown. The Obama administration’s goal is to continue managing that transition, most recently through the controversial Big Thorne timber sale. Forrest Cole is the forest supervisor. In 2013 he announced the Big Thorne Project, the name of the current logging operation on Prince of Wales. “By providing a stable supply of timber to the industry now, we are giving the Forest Service and the industry the breathing space needed to prepare for the transition to young-growth timber.” In other words, the industry can cut down a limited number of old trees now while it waits for younger ones to grow. Mills on Prince of Wales were built to cut larger, older trees. The younger, second-growth trees the Forest Service more readily allows to be logged are shipped to Asia and milled there more cheaply. Although the Forest Service has cast Big Thorne as providing enough old-growth trees to keep the mill busy for six to 10 years, industry leaders say there may be enough timber to last only three or four years. The mill on Prince of Wales is viewed as important because it provides year-round work, while logging jobs are seasonal. “We don’t need a lot of it,” Graham said of the old-growth forest, noting that the Forest Service says 90 percent of old growth in the Tongass remains intact. “We just need enough to get us through these next 30 years, maybe 2 (percent) or 3 percent of it. There’s plenty of room to have a few sawmills with year-round jobs and still have this last old-growth forest out there untouched.” Conservationists say logging old-growth trees to save sawmills is misguided, because it puts wildlife and the forest at risk for a few dozen wood jobs. “There’s got to be a way to transition this small number of people and communities in a way that makes sense, instead of just totally trashing this species and this ecosystem,” said Larry Edwards.
