Researchers say more efforts are needed to protect Borneo's shrinking orangutan population. ![Image 2\. Borneo's location in Southeast Asia [click to expand]](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/Borneo.png) Orangutans are disappearing from Borneo.  The island, located in Southeast Asia, includes three countries. They are Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.  Orangutans, like chimpanzees and gorillas, belong to the group of animals called the great apes. Humans belong to this group, too.  However, human activities are causing Orangutans to die off. Hunting and killing have caused the orangutans' population to decline. Nearly 150,000 animals have been lost from the island of Borneo’s forests in 16 years, conservationists have discovered. Conservationists work to preserve and protect wildlife. The worst losses occurred in regions where the forests have been cut down. People are making way for farms that produce palm oil and acacia. Palm oil is used in all kinds of products, from snack foods to lip gloss. Palm oil is a major cause of deforestation today. Sap from acacia trees is also used in many products. They include paints, candies and even fireworks.  Many orangutans were also killed by hunters who went into the forest. Others were killed by farmworkers when the apes came onto the farmland, a study found. Researchers estimate that about 70,000 to 100,000 orangutans remain on Borneo. The population has been cut by more than half over the study period, which ran from 1999 to 2015\. Without new efforts to protect the animals, the numbers could fall at least another 45,000 in the next 35 years, the conservationists predict. The real decline could be worse because the prediction is based only on the loss of their nests.  An international team of conservationists wrote the report on the orangutans. Serge Wich is an expert on orangutans and their habitats. He helped work on the new report. He said his team was surprised by the results. “You think the numbers can’t be that high, but unfortunately they are.” The researchers studied 16 years of ground and helicopter surveys. The surveys had counted the numbers and locations of nests that orangutans built in the trees from branches and leaves. The nests are used to estimate the sizes of orangutan populations. The animals themselves are hard to find. <img class="centered" alt="Image 3.

The experts identified 64 separate groups of orangutans on the island. However, only 38 are thought to make up more than 100 individuals. This is the minimum scientists say a group can have to survive. The forests of Borneo are being split apart by new farms and building projects. The loss of trees caused three-fourths of the local orangutan population to die off, the study found. In the dense forests, orangutan numbers fell by half. This is even worse for the animals. Most of them live in the dense forest areas. Hunters in Borneo tend to go into the forest to find pigs and deer. However, if they see a large orangutan, they can take the animals for food. Female orangutans are occasionally killed for their young, which are sold as pets. Far more of the apes die when they go on to plantations and into people’s gardens. There, they are shot or killed with machetes, large sharp objects used to cut plants. Last week, officials on Borneo found the body of a male orangutan. It had machete scars and wounds from 130 airgun pellets. “We need to work with people to help them understand that orangutans are not dangerous and that it’s illegal to kill them,” Wich said. He has one idea. Perhaps famous people in Indonesia and Malaysia could raise awareness of orangutans on platforms like Instagram. “We know this decline has been largely due to hunting, and if we can turn that around, these orangutans could, over a long period, bounce back. When you lost the habitat, it’s gone forever, but the forests are still there. If we can stop the hunting and killing, we can reverse the trend," Wich said. "Hunting threatens the existence of this magnificent great ape," said Emma Keller. She works at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a group that works on conservation projects around the world.  "Immediate action is needed to reform industries that have pushed orangutans to the brink of extinction," she said. People can make a difference by only buying palm oil products that are farmed responsibly, she said.
