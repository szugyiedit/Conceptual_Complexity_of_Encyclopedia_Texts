Seahorse genome study sheds light on strange species Seahorses are one of a kind. They have long mouths. But, they do not have teeth. They are covered with a hard coat. And, the dads have the babies. Why are they so different from other things in the sea? No one knew for sure for a long time. Now, we have some answers. Scientists studied seahorses. They looked at seahorses' genome. All living things have a genome. The genome is a set of directions. This is how living things know how to grow. The scientists discovered changes in seahorses' genomes. These changes have made the seahorse look how it looks today. The scientists studied other sea animals, too. They found fish that were almost the same as seahorses. They compared them to the seahorses. They found answers for the seahorses' differences. One example is seahorses' mouths. Seahorses are missing the genes that make teeth. This may be why they have mouths that look like straws. But, the scientists still are not sure about one thing. They do not know why the dads have the babies.Â  Male seahorses hold eggs in a pouch. They keep them there until the baby seahorses are born. The pouch helps the eggs hatch. Knowing these facts is important. It will help scientists learn more about seahorses.
