Turtles are cool — from their history to their shells to their colors What would it be like to be a turtle?  What would you eat? You would hunt for bugs, plants or other turtles' eggs to eat. How would you stay warm in the winter? You would cover yourself in mud. How would you protect yourself? You might be able to hide in your shell.  There are more than 300 kinds of turtles in the world. Turtles have been around for a very long time. They used to be much bigger.  Turtles have a hard back called a shell. They cannot leave their shells. Turtles that live on land have round shells. Turtles that live in water have shells that are good for swimming. Shells may be different patterns or colors. Many turtles live in ponds. They lay their eggs on land, though. They also climb on logs to rest in the sun. Their feet are webbed.  One kind of turtle is the northern diamondback terrapin. It lives in Maryland, a state on the East Coast.  Karyn Molines works for Maryland's parks. She says you can see a diamondback from a boat. You can see "their eyes and noses popping up out of the water," she said.  Turtles do not make great pets. Some can live 80 years or more. Turtles need good lighting, lots of food and a clean home. What would happen to your turtle if you got tired of caring for it? It is mean to drop it off in the woods. The Humane Society of America is a group that protects animals. It says turtles should be left in the wild.  You do not have to get a pet turtle to see one. Go watch turtles in the wild. Take photos. You will find out more about their lives. They will be much happier. If a turtle is out of water, it may not be in trouble. It may be a mother going to or from her nest. A turtle may need help getting across a road. Be careful. Some turtles can bite.
