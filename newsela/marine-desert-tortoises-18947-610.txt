Tortoise relocation put on hold TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. - There are soldiers who live at a Marine base in the desert town of Twentynine Palms, California. Tortoises live at the base, too.  One important rule at the base is, "Don't hurt the desert tortoises." A desert tortoise is a kind of turtle that lives in the hot, sandy desert. It has a tall, green or brown shell. It also has flat front legs for digging. A desert tortoise can be as tall as a cat. It can be as heavy as a small dog. A desert tortoise can even live as long as 100 years. It lives in California and three other states. Tortoises live in the desert near the Marine base. The Marines say they take good care of the animals. Marines and scientists help care for young tortoises. People on base are also told not to drop food. This is because food brings ravens. The big black birds eat tortoises.  Animal rights groups care about land and animals. Some of those groups are fighting with the Marines. They want to protect the tortoises. The problem is a planned Marine practice. It would use guns, bombs and tanks. The practice would be near where desert tortoises live. The Marines do have a plan to keep the animals from getting hurt. They want to fly many of the tortoises to a new home. Animal rights groups do not like the plan. They say the move would kill many tortoises. They also say that it would break a law. The law protects animals that are in danger of becoming extinct. The Marines say they will take good care of the tortoises. "We're not just going to throw them over a fence," says Walter Christensen. He protects the wildlife at the base. Christensen says that the turtles will be moved nearby. There will be water and food. The Marines have also moved the training. They plan to stay away from areas where tortoises live. The Marines will use fewer tanks. No bombs will blow up where the animals live. A government group still has to agree to the move. The group will decide in September.
