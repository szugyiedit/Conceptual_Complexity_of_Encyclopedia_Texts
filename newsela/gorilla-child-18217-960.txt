Director defends decision ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/CORRECTIONZooGorillaEdit.jpg) CINCINNATI, Ohio — The head of the Cincinnati Zoo on Monday defended the decision to kill a gorilla to protect a boy who entered its exhibit. Zoo Director Thane Maynard said that it's easy to second-guess the decision now that the child is safe. The male western lowland gorilla named Harambe was killed Saturday by a special zoo response team that feared for the boy's safety. Video taken by zoo visitors showed that the gorilla at times appeared to be protective of the boy. However, Harambe also dragged him through a shallow moat. Maynard said the gorilla was agitated and disoriented by the confusion during the 10 minutes after the boy fell. He said the gorilla could crush a coconut in one hand and there was no doubt that the boy's life was in danger. "We stand by our decision," he said Monday. He reiterated that using a tranquilizer on the 420-pound gorilla could have further threatened the boy because the gorilla would not have immediately gone to sleep. Maynard said a review indicates the boy climbed over a 3-foot-high railing. He then walked through an area of bushes about 4 feet deep before plunging some 15 feet into the moat. The boy was treated at a hospital and released that same day. Maynard said the zoo remains safe for its some 1.6 million annual visitors. Nonetheless, a review is underway for possible improvements. Kim O'Connor, who witnessed the boy's fall, told WLWT-TV that she heard the youngster say he wanted to get in the water with the gorillas. She said the boy's mother was with several other young children and told him no. Anthony Seta, an animal rights supporter in Cincinnati, helped organize a memorial service Monday just outside the zoo gates. He said the gathering was not intended to place blame for Harambe's death. Instead, it was meant to honor the gorilla, who turned 17 the day before he was shot. "People can shout at the parents and people can shout at the zoo," Seta said. "The fact is that a gorilla that just celebrated his birthday has been killed." In the days since, people have taken to social media to voice their outrage about the killing of a member of an endangered species. A Facebook page called "Justice for Harambe" was created. Another page called for a June 5 protest at the zoo. Maynard said the zoo had received messages of support and sympathy from around the world. Some of these messages came from other zoo leaders and gorilla experts. A spokesman for Jane Goodall, who is famous for studying primates like gorillas, said she had "a private conversation" with Maynard. He said that she expressed her sympathy. Maynard said zoo visitors have been leaving flowers at the exhibit. They have also been asking how they could support gorilla conservation. "This is very emotional and people have expressed different feelings," Maynard said by email. "Not everyone shares the same opinion and that's OK. But we all share the love for animals." The Gladys Porter Zoo said Monday that its staff was deeply saddened by the gorilla's death. Harambe spent most of his life at the Brownsville, Texas, zoo. He was sent to Cincinnati less than two years ago.  Many social media commenters have criticized the boy's parents and said they should be held accountable. A Cincinnati police spokesman said no charges were being considered. A spokeswoman for the family said Monday they had no plans to comment. "I do think there's a degree of responsibility they have to be held to," said Kate Villanueva. The mother of two children from Erlanger, Kentucky, started the "Justice for Harambe" page. She also attended Monday's memorial service. "You have to be watching your children at all times." Jack Hanna, host of "Jack Hanna's Into the Wild," said the zoo made the right call by shooting the gorilla. Hanna said he saw video of the gorilla jerking the boy through the water. He said he knew what would happen if the animal wasn't killed. "I'll bet my life on this, that child would not be here today," Hanna told WBNS-TV. The zoo said that it's the first time this has happened at its Gorilla World exhibit, which opened in 1978\. Maynard said plans to expand the exhibit announced earlier this year would proceed as scheduled. Gorilla World remained closed Monday. Maynard said it could reopen next weekend.
