Turtle study ties warmth to gender Turtles are unusual. The way they become a boy or a girl is not like most animals. Most animals work the same way. Chromosomes decide if a baby becomes a boy or a girl.  <img class="pull-right" src="https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/turtles.jpg"/> Chromosomes are passed down from parent to child. They carry the genes that make us what we are. Some genes gives us red hair. Others makes us a boy or girl. With turtles, something else helps them turn into a boy or girl. Temperature is what makes the difference. It all depends on how hot or cold it is outside the egg. Warmer temperatures usually make a turtle become a girl. Cooler temperatures usually make it turn into a boy.  Scientists are still trying to understand how and why that happens.  For the most part, turtles become boys or girls in the same way as other animals. Genes do most of the work. As different kinds of genes get turned on, boy or girl parts begin to grow. Eventually, a baby boy or girl is formed. These genes do not react to the temperature, though. Some turtle gene must sense the temperature outside the egg. Then, it must tell the other genes what to do. Scientist Turk Rhen thinks that special gene is something called CIRBP. He ran a test that shows how it works, he says.  Rhen put turtle eggs in heated boxes. Then, he changed the temperature. Next, he studied the turtles. He wanted to see how their bodies reacted. The CIRBP genes turned on as soon as the temperature changed, Rhen says. Soon after, the genes that make turtles boys or girls also began working. Rhen thinks the CIRBP gene directed all the other genes. He also thinks he knows why turtles are the way they are.  Boy or man turtles are called male. Girl or woman turtles are called female.  Larger male turtles do better than smaller ones. They fight better.  Turtles in eggs grow faster when temperatures are colder. Turtles that grow faster end up larger.  If temperatures are warmer, turtles turn out smaller. A smaller body is not a problem for female turtles. For that reason, it is better for a small turtle to be female.  When it is cold the CIRBP gene tells other genes to make the baby a boy. When it is warm it tells them to make the baby a girl. All this may seem strange. It makes perfect sense for turtles, though.
