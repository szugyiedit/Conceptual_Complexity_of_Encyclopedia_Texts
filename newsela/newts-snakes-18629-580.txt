Timeless tug of war A long time ago, three hunters died around a campfire in Oregon. No one knew how they died but next to them was a coffee pot. A dead newt was inside. Newts are very toxic. Some people thought the newt could have killed them. In the 1960s, two scientists became interested in the story. They wanted to know how newts became so deadly. They were a father and son team. The two scientists made a discovery. They found that some newts and snakes were changing in an interesting way. They were evolving, or going through an evolution. The newts would have baby newts. Some of these baby newts were more poisonous than others. The most poisonous newts would live longer. Their poison helped them avoid getting eaten by snakes. Because of this, certain kinds of newts became more poisonous. Something similar happened to the snakes. They would have baby snakes. Some of the snakes would be better at not dying from the newt poison. These snakes lived longer. These snakes would have baby snakes, which would be better at fighting the newt poison. The poison was called tetrodotoxin (TTX). It is a super deadly poison made by newts. A new study by the scientists came out Thursday. The study shows this evolution began 170 million years ago. It began long before newts and snakes were around. The scientists discovered changes in an early lizard. It was not affected by TTX poison. Joel McGlothlin helped write the study. He is a scientist at Virginia Tech. McGlothlin hopes that other scientists will use their work. It could help them understand how other creatures developed.
