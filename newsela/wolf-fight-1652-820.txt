A federal agency's plan to extend protections to the Mexican wolves in New Mexico and Arizona has sparked a hot and noisy debate. ![](https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20130426_WOLVES.jpg)ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Children in Reserve, N.M., wait for the school bus inside cages made of wood and wire. The small town is far from the city and the "kid cages" are there to protect them from wolves. Parents think the cages are a good idea. Defenders of the wolves see it another way. They point out that there have been no recorded wolf attacks in New Mexico or Arizona. Fears of wolves attacking humans, they say, are exaggerated. They call the cages nothing more than a stunt. In 1995, Canadian gray wolves were reintroduced into the northern Rockies. People got really angry. Now that anger has flowed into the Southwest. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to extend protection for an estimated 75 Mexican wolves in the wild in New Mexico and Arizona. They would make it against the law to kill wolves, in most instances. The new plan would also significantly expand the area where the wolves would be protected. Some people in the West do not like the plan. They see protecting the wolves as a well-meaning effort by officials who don’t know what it’s like to live with wolves. “People have to stand up and defend our rights,” said Wink Crigler. She is a fifth-generation rancher from Arizona. Crigler says guests at her tourist cabins fear they might be attacked by wolves. Anti-wolf materials here often show the animal as a savage devil preying on children. The signs and advertisements are paid for by political groups that do not like the federal government. The anger has led to the illegal killings of many Mexican wolves. The number of Mexican wolves had fallen to seven before 1998 when the U.S. government tried to bring them back in 1998. Mexican wolves are smaller and browner than Canadian grays. A young male wolf was killed by an arrow a few weeks ago. The shooting happened in the same Catron County that uses the kid cages. U.S. officials are expected to finalize their plan for dealing with Mexican wolves by the end of the year. “We can’t just listen to the loudest voice in the room,” said Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe. “There are many loud voices in the room." An Oct. 4 public comment hearing about wolf management was postponed when the government shut down. But supporters of each side came out anyway. The took over meeting rooms in a nearby hotel. The Save the Lobo rally was paid for by Defenders of Wildlife. It featured a man in a wolf costume. Down the hall, the anti-wolf event was sponsored by Americans for Prosperity. The group gets money from the conservative Koch brothers. The group screened the movie “Wolves in Government Clothing.” The film said rampaging wolves were like an out-of-control federal government. The issue of public safety loomed large at the meetings. There was a lot of discussion about the kid cages. The cages look like chicken coops. Photos and video of the cages have been circulated by Americans for Prosperity. But it is not clear how many cages exist or who requested or paid for them. Local media reports suggest at least some of them were built by students in a high school shop class. Calls to the superintendent of schools in Reserve were not returned. Carolyn Nelson is a teacher in Catron County. She thinks the cages don’t go far enough to protect children. She said that seven years ago her son, then 14, was out walking and came across three wolves. Frightened, he backed against a tree as one wolf stared him down while the other two circled. Only when the boy cocked the gun he was carrying did the wolves run off. “I think it was a miracle he wasn’t killed,” she said. Crigler, the Arizona rancher, who also attended the event, said she understands the fears of the guests in her tourist cabins. “I can’t tell them that they are perfectly safe. There is some degree of risk,” she said, adding that she worries that the wolves are becoming too used to people. “They are meat eaters. Savages.” Carlos Carroll says the chances of wolves targeting people is low. He is one of the scientists studying Mexican wolves for the Fish and Wildlife Service. “All we can go on is what has happened in the past,” said Carroll. Only two or three attacks have happened in the past 10 years, and they were in Alaska and Canada “where there are thousands of wolves,” he said.
