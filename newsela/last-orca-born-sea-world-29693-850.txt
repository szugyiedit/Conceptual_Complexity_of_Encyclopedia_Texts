Very last orca bred in confinement MIAMI, Florida — The last whale to be born in SeaWorld has just arrived. About a year ago, SeaWorld decided to stop breeding orcas. It has faced protests over the way it treats the animals and fewer people are visiting the park. SeaWorld said the orca was born last week on Wednesday. They have not named it yet because they are not sure if it is male or female. Both mother and calf appear healthy.  The mother is 25-year-old Takara. She was already carrying the baby whale when SeaWorld announced in March 2016 that it had stopped breeding its orcas. Orca pregnancy lasts for about 18 months.  Chris Dold is in charge of the animals at SeaWorld. He expected the park to be at least a little sad because it would be the park's last birth. On Wednesday, he said everyone at SeaWorld only felt like celebrating. He was returning from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates located in the Middle East, where SeaWorld is building its first park without orcas. SeaWorld will end its famous whale shows by 2019\. Many people are against keeping killer whales and other animals in theme parks like SeaWorld. More people think they should be returned to the sea. They do not think the whales should be forced to perform tricks. Documentaries, movies based on facts, like "Blackfish," make it seem like keeping orcas at SeaWorld is cruel. They do not have nearly as much space to swim as they do in the wild. "Blackfish" was released in 2013\. It talked about the orca Tilikum, who killed trainer Dawn Brancheau in Orlando in 2010.  Tilikum fathered 14 calves over nearly 25 years in Orlando. He died in January. The newborn calf's father is Kyuquot who lives in the San Antonio park in Texas. It brings SeaWorld's orca population in the U.S. to 23\. All the orcas will remain on display in the United States. Researchers will be able to continue studying them.  SeaWorld has said it will introduce new "natural orca encounters" instead of theatrical shows. This summer, the San Diego park will open one of the new displays. More will follow in San Antonio and Orlando. Dold said veterinarians at the San Antonio park told him the calf was born normally. Both orcas were swimming calmly. "Mom generally will rest but she can't rest too much .... mom's not holding onto the calf, but it's riding in her slipstream, and that's how it gets around," Dold said. "Our expectation is that all of this will go smoothly, but we take none of that for granted." Suzanne Pelisson is a spokesperson for SeaWorld. She says they will use birth control and "social management" to prevent orca pregnancies. SeaWorld has not collected a wild orca in nearly 40 years. Most of its orcas were born in their theme parks. Researchers are worried about SeaWorld's decision to stop breeding orcas. It will make it harder for them to study orca health, growth and behavior. In the coming years, they will be limited to studying a small pod of aging whales. Heather Hill studies animal behavior. She plans to watch the sleeping habits of Takara and the calf over the next year. She said it was frustrating to see research opportunities at SeaWorld cut down by public opinion as the national government cuts funding for science.  Tracy Reiman is vice president for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. It is a national group fighting for rights and protections of animals. She said the mother and her calf should be sent to a safe place in the ocean. This is Takara's fifth calf. Only two of her calves are in the same park as her. SeaWorld does not plan to move her or any more of its orcas.  Dold said in March that SeaWorld remains committed to studying and saving orcas. It said the last orca birth is a sad reminder of how things change.
