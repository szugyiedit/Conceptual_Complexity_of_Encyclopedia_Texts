Experts examine wolf pups to better understand the wolf population Carolin Humpal hears quiet animal sounds from inside a den. A den is a hole in the ground. A den is also the baby wolves' home. Ms. Humpal is a scientist. She likes to learn about animals. Ms. Humpal peeked inside the hole. She found five baby wolves. They were curled up in their den. Ms. Humpal works with other scientists. They work as a team. They want to learn more about how many wolves there are in Minnesota. The scientists want to learn how to find the baby wolves' homes. Then, they will count how many wolves there are. They want to learn how the pups stay alive. They go back to find the hole. After a long time, Ms. Humpal's team found the den of baby wolves.  The mother of the baby wolves is not in the hole. Scientists think that the mother is not far. They think that she is looking at them. The scientists think that she wants them to leave. The scientists go inside the hole.   They do their work quickly. They are very quiet. The scientists do not see the mother wolf, and leave.  Ms. Humpal and her team have been studying baby wolves for a long time.  They want to know if the mother wolf will move the baby wolves to another hole if they visit their hole. The scientists think she will move her baby wolves.  But they are not sure.  Scientists also know that wolves change homes even if people do not come to their home.
