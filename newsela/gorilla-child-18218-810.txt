Director defends decision ![](https://media.newsela.com/article_media/extra/CORRECTIONZooGorillaEdit.jpg) CINCINNATI, Ohio — On Monday, the head of the Cincinnati Zoo defended the decision to kill a gorilla. The animal was killed to protect a 4-year-old boy who entered its exhibit. In his statement, Zoo director Thane Maynard noted that it's easy to second-guess the decision after the child was recovered safely. Gorillas are large apes that come from Africa. This male western lowland gorilla named Harambe was killed Saturday by a special team of zoo workers that feared for the boy's safety. Harambe appeared in the video to be protecting the boy. However, he also dragged him through a moat. Maynard said the gorilla was upset by the noise during the 10 minutes after the boy fell. The gorilla could crush a coconut in one hand, so there was no doubt that the boy's life was in danger, he said. Maynard said a review indicates the boy climbed over a 3-foot-high railing. He then walked through an area of bushes about 4 feet deep. Finally, he plunged 15 feet into the moat. The boy was treated at a hospital and released the same day. Maynard said the zoo remains safe. Nonetheless, a review is underway for possible improvements. Kim O'Connor witnessed the boy's fall. She told WLWT-TV that she heard the boy say he wanted to get in the water with the gorillas. She said the boy's mother was with several other children and told him no. Anthony Seta is an animal rights supporter in Cincinnati. He held a memorial service Monday just outside the zoo. He said the gathering was not intended to place blame for Harambe's death. Instead, it was meant to honor the gorilla. Harambe turned 17 the day before he was shot. "People can shout at the parents and people can shout at the zoo," Seta said. "The fact is that a gorilla that just celebrated his birthday has been killed." In the days since, people have taken to the Internet to voice anger about the killing of an endangered animal. A Facebook page called "Justice for Harambe" was created. Another page called for a June 5 protest at the zoo. Maynard said the zoo had received messages of support from around the world. Some of these messages came from other zoo leaders and gorilla experts. A spokesman for Jane Goodall, a famous scientist who studies gorillas, said she spoke with Maynard.  Maynard said zoo visitors have left flowers at the exhibit. They have also asked how they could help gorillas. "This is very emotional, and people have expressed different feelings," Maynard said by email. "Not everyone shares the same opinion, and that's OK. But we all share the love for animals." The Gladys Porter Zoo said Monday that its workers were deeply saddened by the gorilla's death. Harambe spent most of his life at this Brownsville, Texas, zoo. He was sent to Cincinnati less than two years ago.  Many online commenters have criticized the boy's parents and said they should be held accountable. A Cincinnati police spokesman said no charges were being considered. A spokeswoman for the family said Monday they had no plans to comment. Kate Villanueva feels the parents of the boy should be held responsible. The mother of two children from Erlanger, Kentucky, started the "Justice for Harambe" page. She also attended Monday's memorial service. "You have to be watching your children at all times." Jack Hanna, from the television series "Jack Hanna's Into the Wild," said the zoo made the right decision. Hanna said he saw video of the gorilla jerking the boy through the water. He said he knew what would happen if the animal wasn't killed. "I'll bet my life on this, that child would not be here today," Hanna told WBNS-TV. The zoo said that it's the first time this has happened at Gorilla World, which opened in 1978\. It remained closed Monday. Maynard said it could reopen next weekend.
